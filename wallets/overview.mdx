Every Fincra account comes with one or more currency wallets. Your wallets are the central financial layer of the platform — payments you receive settle into them, payouts are debited from them, and currency conversions move funds between them.

## How wallets work

  <Card title="Payments credit your wallet" icon="circle-dollar-to-slot">
    When a customer completes a payment, funds settle into your wallet in the payment currency.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Payouts debit your wallet" icon="paper-plane">
    When you initiate a payout, funds are deducted from your wallet in the source currency. Your wallet must have sufficient balance before a payout is processed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Conversions move funds between wallets" icon="arrow-right-arrow-left">
    Currency Conversion lets you move funds from one currency wallet to another at a locked exchange rate.

## Sandbox wallets

On first login to sandbox, your available wallets depend on your registration country:

| Registration country | Sandbox wallets |
|---|---|
| Nigeria | NGN wallet only — create additional currency wallets via the [Create Wallet](/wallets/manage-wallets#create-a-wallet) endpoint |
| Any other country | All supported currency wallets created automatically |

You can fund any sandbox wallet instantly from the dashboard or via API. See [Fund Your Wallet](/wallets/fund-your-wallet).
