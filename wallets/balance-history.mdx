Balance history gives you a full log of every credit and debit against a wallet — payments received, payouts sent, conversions, and top-ups. You can access it from the dashboard or pull it via API.

## Dashboard export

1. Go to the **Balance** tab in [app.fincra.com](https://app.fincra.com)
2. Select the currency wallet you want to view
3. Export the wallet logs as a CSV

## API

Fetch wallet balance history for a specific currency programmatically:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.fincra.com/wallets/balance-history' \
  --header 'api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```
