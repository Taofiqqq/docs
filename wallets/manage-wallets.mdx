## Create a wallet

Nigerian accounts start with an NGN wallet only. Use the Create Wallet endpoint to add wallets in any other currency you need.

<Info>
  Create Wallet endpoint path and request payload will be documented here once confirmed. Expected fields: currency code (e.g. `USD`, `KES`, `GHS`).
</Info>

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.fincra.com/wallets' \
  --header 'api-key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    ...
  }'
```

<Note>
  If you registered with a country other than Nigeria, all currency wallets are created automatically when you sign up — you do not need to use this endpoint.
</Note>

Once created, the wallet is immediately available for payments, payouts, and conversions in that currency.

## Fetch all wallets

Retrieve all wallets on your account with their current balances:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.fincra.com/wallets' \
  --header 'api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

<Info>
  Fetch all wallets endpoint path and response fields will be documented here once confirmed. Expected response: array of wallet objects with currency, balance, and wallet number.
</Info>

## Fetch a single wallet

Retrieve a specific wallet by currency or wallet ID:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.fincra.com/wallets/{walletId}' \
  --header 'api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

<Info>
  Fetch single wallet endpoint path, path parameter, and response fields will be documented here once confirmed.
</Info>

## Wallet number

Every wallet has a unique wallet number. This is the identifier used when receiving [Wallet Transfers](/payouts/wallet-transfers) from other Fincra accounts — share it with anyone who wants to pay you directly wallet-to-wallet.
