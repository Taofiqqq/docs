There are three ways to add funds to a Fincra wallet — which one you use depends on whether you're in sandbox or production.

## Sandbox: Fund via dashboard

The fastest way to add test funds in sandbox:

1. Log in to [app.fincra.com](https://app.fincra.com) and make sure you're in **Test Mode**
2. Go to the **Balance** tab
3. Click **Fund Balance**
4. Select the currency wallet and enter the amount
5. Confirm — funds are credited instantly

## Sandbox: Fund via API

You can also fund sandbox wallets programmatically — useful if you want to automate your test setup.

<Info>
  Fund Wallet API endpoint path and request payload will be documented here once confirmed. Expected fields: currency, amount, business ID.
</Info>

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://sandboxapi.fincra.com/wallets/fund' \
  --header 'api-key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    ...
  }'
```

## Production: Manual top-up

In production, wallet funding is a manual process coordinated with Fincra:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request a top-up">
    Go to the **Balance** tab in your live dashboard and submit a top-up request. Specify the currency you want funded and the amount.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive payment details">
    Fincra provides you with a bank account to pay into, along with the amount and applicable exchange rate (for non-NGN currencies).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make the payment">
    Transfer the specified amount to the provided account from your bank.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wallet is credited">
    Once Fincra confirms receipt of your funds, your wallet is credited in the requested currency.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Production top-up timelines depend on your bank and the currency. Reach out to your account manager if you need a top-up urgently before a large disbursement.
