Fincra lets you send payouts to recipients in local currencies across Africa and internationally in USD, GBP, and EUR. This guide walks you through the key decisions before you start building.

## Choose your payout destination

| If you're paying... | Use this |
|---|---|
| A bank account (NGN, ZAR, GHS, KES, UGX, ZMW, TZS, EGP, USD, GBP, EUR) | Bank Account payout |
| A mobile wallet (GHS, KES, UGX, ZMW, TZS, XAF, XOF, EGP) | Mobile Money payout |
| Another Fincra wallet | [Wallet Transfer](/payouts/wallet-transfers) |

See [Payout Coverage](/payouts/payout-coverage) for the full breakdown by country.

## Same currency vs. cross currency

| Scenario | What happens |
|---|---|
| Source and destination currency match | Payout processes immediately — no quote needed |
| Source and destination currency differ | Fincra generates an FX quote → you have **30 seconds** to accept before it expires |

<Warning>
  FX quotes expire after 30 seconds. Build your integration to handle quote expiry gracefully — surface the re-quote step clearly to your users.
</Warning>

## International payouts (USD, GBP, EUR)

For international payouts, you choose the payment scheme:

| Currency | Available schemes |
|---|---|
| USD | ACH, Fedwire, SWIFT |
| GBP | FPS, CHAPS, SWIFT |
| EUR | SEPA, SEPA Instant, SWIFT |

SWIFT opens up payouts beyond the US, UK, and Eurozone to countries including Nigeria (domiciliary accounts), Hong Kong, China, and more.

## How it works

1. **Add your recipient** — create a beneficiary with their bank account or mobile money details, or pass the details inline in the payout request
2. **Initiate the payout** — `POST /disbursements/payouts` with source currency, destination currency, amount, and recipient details
3. **Accept the FX quote** (cross-currency only) — if currencies differ, accept the quote within 30 seconds
4. **Track the payout** — listen for `payout.successful` or `payout.failed` webhooks, or poll using the payout reference
5. **Handle failures** — check the failure reason and retry or notify the recipient as needed

See [Initiate Transfer](/payouts/initiate-transfer) for the full request and response.

## Payout statuses

Payouts move through a simple three-state lifecycle:

`processing` → `successful` / `failed`

Webhook events: `payout.successful`, `payout.failed`.
