Fincra gives you multiple ways to accept payments depending on how much control you want over the checkout experience and how your product is built. This guide helps you pick the right one.

## Choose your integration method

| If you want to... | Use this |
|---|---|
| Get up and running with minimal code | [Payment Links](/payments/overview) |
| Redirect customers to a Fincra-hosted checkout page | [Hosted Payment Page](/payments/hosted-payment-page) |
| Embed a checkout UI directly into your website | [Drop-in Checkout](/drop-in-element) |
| Handle payments entirely server-side with full control | [Direct Charge API](/payments/overview) |
| Let customers pay via bank transfer to a dedicated account | [Virtual Accounts](/payments/overview) |

## What your customers can pay with

Depending on your integration method and the customer's country, Fincra supports:

| Payment method | Supported via |
|---|---|
| Cards (Visa, Mastercard, Verve) | Checkout, Direct Charge API |
| Bank Transfer | Virtual Accounts, Direct Charge API |
| Mobile Money | Direct Charge API |
| PayAttitude (USSD) | Direct Charge API |
| EFT | Direct Charge API |
| PalmPay | Checkout (NGN only) |

<Note>
  Checkout (Hosted Payment Page and Drop-in) supports African currencies only. For international card payments, use the Direct Charge API.
</Note>

## How it works

1. **Choose your integration method** — pick based on your use case above
2. **Create your account and complete KYC** — most payment methods are available immediately after verification; some (Direct Charge API, card collections, mobile money) require activation via your account manager
3. **Test in sandbox** — use [test values](/sandbox/testing) to simulate success, decline, and failure scenarios
4. **Go live** — toggle to Live Mode, swap your API key and base URL, and you're collecting real payments

<Info>
  Virtual Accounts and Payment Links are available immediately after KYC approval. Direct Charge API, card collections, and mobile money require activation — contact your account manager.
