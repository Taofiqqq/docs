Virtual Accounts are dedicated bank account numbers that Fincra generates for you. Each account is tied to your Fincra wallet — when a customer sends a bank transfer to a virtual account, the funds land in your wallet automatically.

No checkout page. No redirect. Just a bank account number your customer pays into directly.

## When to use virtual accounts

| Use case | Example |
|---|---|
| B2B invoice collection | Send a client an invoice with a dedicated bank account to pay into |
| Marketplace funding | Let sellers or buyers top up their balance via bank transfer |
| Customer wallet top-ups | Allow users to fund their in-app balance |
| Recurring transfers | Give regular payers a permanent account they always send to |

## Types of virtual accounts

Fincra offers two types:

| Type | How it works | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| **Temporary** | One-time use — expires after a single payment or a set time | Single invoices, one-off collections |
| **Permanent** | Reusable — same account number, receives multiple payments | Regular payers, wallet top-ups, recurring inflows |

<Note>
  NGN virtual accounts support both temporary and permanent types. KES, GHS, and TZS support permanent accounts only. USD, GBP, EUR, and CAD permanent accounts are for international wire transfers.
</Note>

## How it works

1. **Create a virtual account** — call the Virtual Accounts API with the currency and type (temporary or permanent)
2. **Share the account details** — pass the returned account number and bank name to your customer
3. **Customer sends a bank transfer** — they pay into the account using their own bank
4. **Funds settle in your wallet** — Fincra matches the incoming transfer to your virtual account and credits your wallet
5. **Webhook fires** — `payment.successful` notifies your system when funds arrive
