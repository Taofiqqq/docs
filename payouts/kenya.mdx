Kenya supports payouts to both bank accounts and mobile money wallets in KES.

## Bank account payouts

Send KES to any Kenyan bank account via local clearing rails.

- **Payment destination:** `bank_account`
- **No payment scheme required** — Fincra routes automatically.
- **Bank code required** — Pass the recipient's bank code in the request.

## Mobile money payouts

Send KES to mobile money wallets in Kenya.

- **Payment destination:** `mobile_money_wallet`
- **Mobile money code required** — Pass the `mobileMoneyCode` for the recipient's provider (e.g., M-Pesa). Retrieve available providers from the List Banks endpoint.
- **Phone number format** — Use country code + number without the `+` symbol (e.g., `254712345678`).
