Wallet Transfers let you move funds from your Fincra wallet directly to another Fincra wallet — instantly, with no fees. Unlike bank account or mobile money payouts, wallet transfers settle immediately and don't require bank details or mobile money codes.

**Endpoint:** `POST /disbursements/payouts/wallets`

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get the recipient's wallet number">
    The recipient shares their Fincra wallet number with you. This is a Fincra-internal identifier — different from a bank account number.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initiate the wallet transfer">
    Call the Wallet Transfer endpoint with the recipient's wallet number, amount, and your reference. No quote needed — wallet transfers are same-currency only.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Funds arrive instantly">
    The transfer settles into the recipient's Fincra wallet immediately. The response returns `status: successful` — no `processing` state.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Constraints

- **Same currency only** — wallet transfers do not support FX. If you need cross-currency movement, use [Currency Conversion](/conversion/overview) first, then transfer.
- **Both parties must be on Fincra** — the recipient must have an active Fincra wallet.
- **Wallet number required** — you cannot initiate a wallet transfer using a bank account number.
