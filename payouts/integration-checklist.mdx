title: "Integration Checklist"
description: "Test your payout integration in sandbox and go live with confidence."
---

Use this checklist to validate your payout integration before switching to production. Fincra's sandbox fully simulates the production environment — webhooks fire, statuses transition, and the complete payout lifecycle runs end-to-end.

## Sandbox environment

- **Base URL:** `https://sandboxapi.fincra.com`
- **API keys:** Generate from the Fincra sandbox dashboard — separate from your production keys
- **Webhooks:** Configure a sandbox webhook endpoint in your dashboard developer settings

## Test data

Use the following test values when initiating payouts in sandbox:

<Info>
  Sandbox test account numbers, bank codes, and mobile money numbers will be documented here. Share these with Taofiq to fill in.

## Sandbox checklist

### API keys and setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate sandbox API key">
    Log in to the Fincra sandbox dashboard and generate your sandbox API key. Keep this separate from your production key.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set base URL to sandbox">
    All requests in sandbox should go to `https://sandboxapi.fincra.com`. Confirm no hardcoded production URLs exist in your integration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm your business ID">
    Retrieve your sandbox business ID from the dashboard — you'll pass this as the `business` field in every payout request.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Webhooks

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure a sandbox webhook endpoint">
    Set up a webhook URL in your sandbox dashboard developer settings. Use a tool like [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) if you don't have a publicly accessible endpoint yet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify webhook signature validation">
    Confirm your server validates the webhook signature on every incoming event. See [Verify Webhooks](/webhooks/verify).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle payout.successful">
    Trigger a successful payout and confirm your webhook handler receives and processes `payout.successful` correctly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle payout.failed">
    Trigger a failed payout and confirm your handler processes `payout.failed` and logs the failure reason.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Payout scenarios

Test each payout type relevant to your integration:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Same-currency bank account payout">
    Initiate a bank account payout where `sourceCurrency` equals `destinationCurrency`. Confirm the response returns `status: processing` with a valid `reference`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Same-currency mobile money payout">
    Initiate a mobile money payout using `paymentDestination: mobile_money_wallet`. Confirm `phone`, `mobileMoneyCode`, and `country` fields are accepted correctly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Cross-currency payout">
    Generate a quote, accept it within 30 seconds, and initiate a payout with the `quoteReference`. Confirm the FX conversion is applied and the payout processes correctly.

    Also test the **expired quote path** — wait for the quote to expire and confirm your integration handles the error gracefully and re-generates a new quote.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wallet transfer">
    Initiate a wallet transfer to a sandbox wallet number. Confirm the response returns `status: successful` immediately — no `processing` state.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Error handling

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test insufficient balance">
    Attempt a payout with an amount exceeding your sandbox wallet balance. Confirm your integration handles the error response and surfaces a clear message.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test invalid account details">
    Submit a payout with an invalid account number or bank code. Confirm the error is caught and handled — do not surface raw API errors to your end users.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test duplicate customerReference">
    Submit two payouts with the same `customerReference`. Confirm only the first is processed and your integration handles the duplicate rejection correctly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Retrieval and reconciliation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Retrieve payout by Fincra reference">
    After initiating a payout, use `GET /disbursements/payouts/reference/{reference}` to retrieve its status. Confirm the response matches the webhook event.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Retrieve payout by customer reference">
    Use `GET /disbursements/payouts/customer-reference/{customerReference}` to look up the same payout. Confirm both lookup paths work and return consistent data.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Store both references">
    Confirm your system stores both Fincra's `reference` and your `customerReference` against each payout record. You'll need both retrieval paths in production.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Beneficiaries

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a beneficiary">
    Save a test recipient as a beneficiary. Confirm the response returns a `beneficiaryId`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Retrieve the beneficiary">
    Fetch the beneficiary by ID and confirm all stored fields are returned correctly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update the beneficiary">
    Update a field (e.g. account number) and confirm the change is reflected on retrieval.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delete the beneficiary">
    Delete the beneficiary and confirm it is no longer retrievable.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Go live checklist

Going live requires only two changes — your API key and base URL. No additional activation is required for payouts.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Switch to production API key">
    Generate a production API key from the live Fincra dashboard. Replace your sandbox key in all environments. Never expose your API key in client-side code.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update base URL to production">
    Switch all requests to `https://api.fincra.com`. Search your codebase for any remaining sandbox URLs before deploying.

    ```
    Sandbox:    https://sandboxapi.fincra.com
    Production: https://api.fincra.com
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure production webhooks">
    Set up your production webhook endpoint in the live dashboard developer settings. Use your production server URL — not localhost or a testing tool.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run a real test transfer">
    Initiate a small-value live payout to a known account you control. Confirm the payout reaches the recipient, the webhook fires, and your system records the outcome correctly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor your first live payouts">
    Watch the first batch of live payouts closely — check webhook delivery, confirm status transitions, and verify reconciliation is working as expected before scaling volume.
  </Step>
</Steps>
