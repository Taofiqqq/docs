title: "Track a Payout"
description: "Retrieve the status of a payout by Fincra reference or your own customer reference."
---

After initiating a payout, use the Track endpoints to check its status or retrieve its full details. Fincra provides two lookup methods — by Fincra's reference or by your own `customerReference`.

## Payout statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `processing` | Fincra has received the request and is processing the transfer |
| `successful` | The payout reached the recipient |
| `failed` | The payout could not be completed — retrieve the payout to see the failure reason |

<Note>
  Use [webhooks](/webhooks/overview) as your primary signal for payout outcomes. Fincra fires `payout.successful` or `payout.failed` as soon as the transfer concludes — no polling needed. Use these GET endpoints for reconciliation, investigations, or handling missed webhooks.
</Note>

## Get by Fincra reference

Retrieve a payout using the `reference` returned in the initiation response:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.fincra.com/disbursements/payouts/reference/424b8226ac3a4407' \
  --header 'api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

**Endpoint:** `GET /disbursements/payouts/reference/{reference}`

## Get by customer reference

Retrieve a payout using your own `customerReference`:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.fincra.com/disbursements/payouts/customer-reference/47fbae28-554f-46c9-852b-464712f491fd' \
  --header 'api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

**Endpoint:** `GET /disbursements/payouts/customer-reference/{customerReference}`

<Info>
  Response payload and fields for both GET endpoints will be documented here once confirmed.

## Which reference to use?

| Situation | Use |
|---|---|
| You stored Fincra's reference from the initiation response | `GET /reference/{reference}` |
| You only have your own internal reference | `GET /customer-reference/{customerReference}` |
| Investigating a webhook — the webhook payload includes both | Either |

This is why storing both the Fincra `reference` and your `customerReference` in your system matters — it gives you two retrieval paths.

## Webhooks vs polling

| Approach | When to use |
|---|---|
| **Webhooks** | Primary — `payout.successful` / `payout.failed` events fire on completion |
| **Get by reference** | Reconcile a specific payout, investigate a failure, or recover from a missed webhook |
| **List payouts** | Batch reconciliation or exporting payout history — see [Reporting](/payouts/reporting) |

To set up webhooks, see [Configure Webhooks](/webhooks/configure).

## Handling failures

If a payout fails:

1. Retrieve the payout using either GET endpoint and read the failure reason
2. Correct the issue (invalid account number, expired quote, insufficient balance)
3. Initiate a **new** payout with a **new** `customerReference` — never reuse the reference from a failed payout
