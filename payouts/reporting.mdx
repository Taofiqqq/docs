Fincra gives you two ways to access your payout history — via the dashboard or the API. Use reporting to reconcile payouts against your internal records, generate accounting exports, or audit disbursements over a date range.

## Dashboard export

You can export your payout history directly from the Fincra dashboard. Filter by date range, currency, or status, then download as a CSV for use in your accounting or reconciliation workflows.

## API export

<Info>
  The payout export API endpoint, request parameters (filters, date range, format), and response structure will be documented here once confirmed.

| `reference` | Fincra's payout reference |
| `customerReference` | Your reference for each payout |
| `amount` | Amount sent |
| `sourceCurrency` | Currency debited from your wallet |
| `destinationCurrency` | Currency received by the recipient |
| `status` | `successful` or `failed` |
| `paymentDestination` | `bank_account` or `mobile_money_wallet` |
| `beneficiary` | Recipient name and account details |
