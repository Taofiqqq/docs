Fincra Payouts lets you send money to bank accounts and mobile money wallets across Africa and internationally — programmatically via the API or manually from the dashboard. Whether you're disbursing payroll, settling vendors, paying out marketplace sellers, or sending remittances, Fincra handles the routing, currency conversion, and settlement so you can focus on your product.

<Note>
  You can also send payouts manually from the [Fincra dashboard](https://dashboard.fincra.com) without writing any code.

## Key benefits

- **Deep African coverage** — Pay out to 10 African countries via local rails, reaching bank accounts and mobile money wallets where your recipients actually receive money.
- **International reach** — Send USD, GBP, and EUR payouts globally via SWIFT, or use local schemes like ACH, Fedwire, FPS, CHAPS, SEPA, and SEPA Instant for faster delivery.
- **One unified flow** — Same-currency and cross-currency payouts use the same API. Cross-currency payouts simply add a quote step with a 30-second rate lock.
- **Fast settlement** — Funds settle to recipients quickly. Local African payouts arrive same-day or next-day. International scheme speeds vary — FPS and SEPA Instant deliver within minutes.

## How it works

<Note>
  **Design team:** Flow diagram needed here — visual showing the unified payout flow: Fund wallet → Choose destination (bank account / mobile money / Fincra account) → Generate quote (if cross-currency) → Submit payout → Funds arrive + webhook notification. Show the quote step as a conditional branch.
</Note>

1. **Fund your wallet** — Ensure your source currency wallet has sufficient funds. You can fund via collections, conversions, or manual top-up.
2. **Choose your destination** — Decide whether you're paying to a bank account, mobile money wallet, or another Fincra account.
3. **Get a quote** *(cross-currency only)* — If the source and destination currencies differ, generate a quote to lock in the exchange rate for 30 seconds.
4. **Submit the payout** — Call the Payout API with the recipient's details, amount, and (if cross-currency) the quote reference.
5. **Funds arrive** — Fincra routes the payout through the appropriate rails. You receive a webhook notification when the payout succeeds or fails.
