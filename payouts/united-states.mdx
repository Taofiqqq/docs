The United States supports three payment schemes for USD bank account payouts. You choose the scheme based on your speed and cost requirements.

## Payment schemes

### ACH

The Automated Clearing House network. Best for routine, non-urgent payouts.

- **API value:** `ach`
- **Settlement:** 1-3 business days
- **Payment destination:** `bank_account`

### Fedwire

The Federal Reserve's real-time gross settlement system. Best for same-day, high-priority payouts.

- **API value:** `fed_wire`
- **Settlement:** Same day
- **Payment destination:** `bank_account`

### SWIFT

International wire transfer network. Use SWIFT for USD payouts to the US or to recipients in other countries who hold USD accounts.

- **API value:** `swift`
- **Settlement:** 1-2 business days
- **Payment destination:** `bank_account`

<Note>
  USD payouts via SWIFT are not limited to the United States. You can send USD to recipients globally where banks accept USD wire transfers — including Nigerian domiciliary accounts at [select banks](/payouts/nigeria).
