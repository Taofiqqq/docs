Uganda supports payouts to both bank accounts and mobile money wallets in UGX.

## Bank account payouts

Send UGX to Ugandan bank accounts via local clearing rails.

- **Payment destination:** `bank_account`
- **No payment scheme required** — Fincra routes automatically.
- **`customerName` field required** — Uganda payout requests use `customerName` alongside standard beneficiary fields.

## Mobile money payouts

Send UGX to mobile money wallets in Uganda.

- **Payment destination:** `mobile_money_wallet`
- **Mobile money code required** — Pass the `mobileMoneyCode` for the recipient's provider. Retrieve available providers from the List Banks endpoint.
- **Phone number format** — Use country code + number without the `+` symbol (e.g., `256772345678`).
- **Whole numbers only** — UGX amounts must be whole numbers with no decimal places when the provider is Airtel.
