description: "Save recipient details for reuse across multiple payouts."

A beneficiary is a saved recipient — a bank account or mobile money wallet you intend to pay. Storing beneficiaries means you only enter and verify a recipient's details once, then reference them by ID on every future payout.

## Before you create a beneficiary

**1. Verify the account first.**
Before saving a new beneficiary, confirm their account details are valid. An unverified account can result in a failed payout that is difficult to reverse.

- Nigerian bank accounts → [Verify a Beneficiary Account — Nigeria](/verification/nigeria)
- Ghanaian mobile money → [Verify a Beneficiary Account — Ghana](/verification/ghana)

**2. Get the correct bank or mobile money code.**
Use the [List Banks](#list-supported-banks-and-mobile-money-providers) endpoint to retrieve the supported bank codes and mobile money wallet codes for the destination country. Pass the code in your create beneficiary request.

## List supported banks and mobile money providers

`GET /core/banks` returns all banks and mobile money wallet providers supported by Fincra, along with their codes, SWIFT codes, and BIC information.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.fincra.com/core/banks' \
  --header 'api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

Use the `code` field from the response as the `bankCode` (for bank account beneficiaries) or the wallet provider code (for mobile money beneficiaries) when creating a beneficiary.

## Beneficiary types

  Endpoint path and response payload coming. This section will include the full curl example, field descriptions table, and a sample success response with the `beneficiaryId` once confirmed.
</Warning>

## After creation: store the beneficiary ID

When a beneficiary is created successfully, Fincra returns a unique `beneficiaryId`. Store this in your system alongside your internal recipient record — you'll reference it when:

- Initiating a payout to this recipient
- Updating their details
- Deleting the record

<Tip>
  Create beneficiary records when you onboard a new recipient — not at payout time. Having records ready before a payroll run or settlement cycle removes a bottleneck from time-sensitive disbursements.
