When a payout request fails, Fincra returns a consistent error response with a machine-readable `errorType` and a human-readable `error` message.

## Error response format

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "You dont have enough money in your wallet to make this payout",
  "errorType": "NO_ENOUGH_MONEY_IN_WALLET"
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `success` | boolean | Always `false` for errors |
| `error` | string | Human-readable description of what went wrong |
| `errorType` | string | Machine-readable error code — use this in your error handling logic |

Always branch on `errorType` in your code, not on the `error` string — the message text may change, the code won't.

---

## Balance errors

| Error code | Message | Cause | What to do |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NO_ENOUGH_MONEY_IN_WALLET` | You dont have enough money in your wallet to make this payout | Your wallet balance is insufficient for the requested amount | Top up your Fincra wallet, then retry the payout with a new `customerReference` |

---

## Quote errors

<Note>
  The following error codes are pending final confirmation — they follow the established Fincra error pattern and will be verified against Postman testing.
</Note>

| Error code | Message | Cause | What to do |
|---|---|---|---|
| `QUOTE_EXPIRED` | Quote has expired | The 30-second quote window passed before the payout was initiated | Generate a new quote and initiate the payout immediately after the customer confirms |
| `INVALID_QUOTE_REFERENCE` | Quote reference is invalid | The `quoteReference` passed does not match any active quote | Verify the reference is copied correctly from the Generate Quote response, then generate a new quote if needed |

---

## Validation errors

| Error code | Message | Cause | What to do |
|---|---|---|---|
| `VALIDATION_FAILED` | Validation failed | One or more required fields are missing, incorrectly formatted, or contain invalid values | Check the response for details on which field failed validation. Common causes: wrong `bankCode`, missing `country` for mobile money, `accountNumber` format mismatch |

---

## Reference errors

| Error code | Message | Cause | What to do |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DUPLICATE_CUSTOMER_REFERENCE` | Customer reference already exists | A payout with this `customerReference` was already submitted | This is intentional — Fincra's idempotency check prevented a duplicate. If this was a retry, retrieve the original payout by `customerReference` to check its status. Never reuse a `customerReference` |

## General guidance

**Retrying failed payouts**

Do not retry a payout by resubmitting the same request. Instead:
1. Investigate the `errorType` and resolve the underlying cause
2. Create a **new** payout request
3. Generate a **new** `customerReference`

**Handling errors in production**

- Never surface raw `error` messages to your end users — map error codes to user-friendly copy in your application
- Log both `errorType` and `error` on every failure for debugging
- Set up alerting on repeated `NO_ENOUGH_MONEY_IN_WALLET` errors — it likely means your wallet needs a top-up process

**Webhook failure events**

Some errors only surface after a payout has been accepted (e.g. bank rejections during processing). These arrive as `payout.failed` webhook events, not as API error responses. Always handle both:
- Synchronous API errors → `success: false` in the response
- Asynchronous failures → `payout.failed` webhook event

See [Webhooks — Events](/webhooks/events) for the full `payout.failed` payload.
