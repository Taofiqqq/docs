Use Fincra Payouts to pay vendors across Africa and internationally. The `customerReference` field maps directly to your invoice number, keeping your accounts payable records in sync without manual matching.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Receive and approve the invoice">
    Your vendor submits an invoice. Once approved internally, retrieve their saved beneficiary record — or create one if this is a new vendor.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify new vendor accounts">
    For any new vendor, confirm their bank account or mobile money details before adding them as a beneficiary. This prevents failed payouts to invalid accounts.

    - Ghanaian mobile money: [Verify a Beneficiary Account — Ghana](/verification/ghana)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate a quote if cross-currency">
    If paying in a different currency from your wallet, generate a quote to lock the exchange rate before proceeding.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initiate the payout">
    Call the [Initiate Transfer](/payouts/initiate-transfer) endpoint. Pass the invoice number as `customerReference` so the payout is traceable end-to-end.

    ```json
    {
      "customerReference": "INV-2026-00483",
      ...
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update your AP system">
    Listen for the `payout.successful` webhook and mark the invoice as paid in your accounts payable system.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Reconciliation mapping

Use `customerReference` to link every Fincra payout to your internal records:

| Your system | Fincra |
|---|---|
| Invoice number | `customerReference` |
| Vendor record | Beneficiary ID |
| Payment date | Payout `createdAt` timestamp |
| Payment status | `payout.successful` / `payout.failed` webhook event |

## Key considerations

  <Card title="Verify new vendors first" icon="circle-check">
    Always verify a new vendor's account details before saving them as a beneficiary. One check upfront prevents a failed payout and a delayed payment.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-currency vendors" icon="globe">
    Pay vendors in their preferred currency — Fincra handles the FX. For wallet-to-wallet currency conversion before initiating a payout, see [Currency Conversion](/conversion/overview).
  </Card>
  <Card title="One beneficiary per vendor" icon="building">
    Save each vendor once and reuse their beneficiary record across all future payments. Update the record if their account details change.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Invoice number as reference" icon="file-invoice">
    Using the invoice number as `customerReference` gives you a direct link between your AP system and Fincra's payout records — no manual matching required.
