title: "Retrieve Beneficiaries"
description: "Fetch a single beneficiary by ID or list all saved beneficiaries."
---

Use the retrieve endpoints to look up saved beneficiary records — either by their ID, or as a filtered list of all beneficiaries on your account.

## Retrieve a single beneficiary

Fetch a specific beneficiary by their ID:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.fincra.com/payouts/beneficiaries/{beneficiaryId}' \
  --header 'api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `beneficiaryId` | string | The unique ID of the beneficiary. Returned when the beneficiary was created. |

<Info>
  Response payload and fields will be documented here once confirmed.
</Info>

## List all beneficiaries

Retrieve all saved beneficiaries on your account:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.fincra.com/payouts/beneficiaries' \
  --header 'api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

<Info>
  Available query filters — such as filtering by currency, payout method, entity type, or name — will be documented here once confirmed.
</Info>

## Using beneficiary IDs in payouts

Once you have a beneficiary's ID, pass it when initiating a payout. This avoids re-submitting their full account details on every transfer and ensures you're always using the verified, saved record.

<Info>
  How `beneficiaryId` is referenced in the Initiate Transfer request body will be documented on the [Initiate Transfer](/payouts/initiate-transfer) page.
