Remittance is one of the most common use cases for Fincra Payouts. Whether you're building a consumer money transfer app, a diaspora platform, or a gig economy product that pays workers in their local currency, Fincra's payout infrastructure handles the cross-border complexity for you.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Collect sender and recipient details">
    Your customer provides the transfer amount, destination country, and the recipient's bank account or mobile money details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify the recipient's account">
    Before initiating a transfer, confirm the recipient's account details are valid. See [Verify a Beneficiary Account](/verification/verify-a-beneficiary-account).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate a quote for cross-currency transfers">
    If the sender's currency differs from the recipient's, call the Generate Quote endpoint to lock in an exchange rate. The quote is valid for **30 seconds** — build your UI to show a countdown and prompt confirmation before expiry.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the recipient as a beneficiary">
    Store the recipient's details as a [beneficiary](/payouts/create-beneficiaries). This lets your customer send to the same person again without re-entering their details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initiate the payout">
    Call the [Initiate Transfer](/payouts/initiate-transfer) endpoint with the beneficiary details, amount, and currency. Pass your internal transfer ID as `customerReference` for reconciliation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Notify the sender">
    Listen for the `payout.successful` or `payout.failed` webhook and update your customer on the transfer outcome in real time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **Diagram needed:** End-to-end remittance flow — sender initiates → (cross-currency branch: quote generated → rate confirmed) → payout triggered → Fincra processes on local rails → recipient receives → webhook fires.
</Note>

## Key considerations

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Lock rates fast" icon="clock">
    Cross-currency quotes expire in **30 seconds**. Generate the quote immediately before your customer confirms — not when they first see the rate.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Verify before sending" icon="circle-check">
    Run account verification before initiating a payout to catch invalid account numbers early. Saves failed payouts and customer frustration.
  </Card>
  <Card title="African rails are instant" icon="bolt">
    Payouts to African bank accounts and mobile money wallets settle instantly. International transfers vary by payment scheme — see [settlement speeds](/payouts/how-payouts-work#payment-schemes).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Track with customerReference" icon="tag">
    Pass your internal transfer ID as `customerReference` to link each Fincra payout to a record in your system.
