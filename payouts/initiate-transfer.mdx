title: "Initiate Transfer"
description: "Send a payout to a bank account or mobile money wallet."
---

The Initiate Transfer endpoint sends money to a recipient's bank account or mobile money wallet. Pass the beneficiary details, amount, and currencies directly in the request body.

**Endpoint:** `POST /disbursements/payouts`

## Before you begin

- Your Fincra wallet must have sufficient funds in the source currency before initiating a payout.
- For cross-currency payouts, [generate a quote](/payouts/how-payouts-work#payment-flow) first and pass the quote reference in the request. Quotes expire in **30 seconds**.
- Use the [List Banks](/payouts/create-beneficiaries#list-supported-banks-and-mobile-money-providers) endpoint to get the correct `bankCode` or `mobileMoneyCode` for the destination.

## Payout flow

```
Same-currency payout
  → Initiate Transfer directly

Cross-currency payout

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.fincra.com/disbursements/payouts' \
  --header 'api-key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \

```

## Cross-currency payout

<Info>
  Cross-currency payout example — including the `quoteReference` field and how it maps to the Generate Quote response — will be added here once confirmed from Postman testing.
</Info>

## Response

A successful initiation returns `status: processing` — the payout is queued and being processed.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Payout initiated successfully.",
  "data": {
    "id": 71624426,
    "reference": "424b8226ac3a4407",
    "customerReference": "47fbae28-554f-46c9-852b-464712f491fd",
    "status": "processing",
    "documentsRequired": []
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `id` | Fincra's internal payout ID |
| `reference` | Fincra's payout reference — use this to [track the payout](/payouts/track-payouts) |
| `customerReference` | Your reference echoed back |
| `status` | Always `processing` on initiation |
| `documentsRequired` | List of any compliance documents required before the payout can proceed. Usually empty — see note below. |

<Note>
  `documentsRequired` is typically an empty array. For certain international transfers, Fincra may require supporting documents (e.g. an invoice for a large SWIFT transfer) before the payout can be processed. If this array is non-empty, upload the required documents before the payout can proceed.
</Note>

## customerReference and idempotency

`customerReference` is your unique identifier for each payout. Fincra uses it to prevent duplicate transfers — two requests with the same `customerReference` will only process once.

- Use a UUID per transfer
- Never reuse a `customerReference`, even after a failure
- Generate a fresh one on every retry

## What happens next

1. Fincra processes the payout — status is `processing`
2. The transfer is sent via local rails or the chosen payment scheme
3. Fincra fires a `payout.successful` or `payout.failed` webhook on completion
4. [Track the payout](/payouts/track-payouts) by `reference` or `customerReference`
