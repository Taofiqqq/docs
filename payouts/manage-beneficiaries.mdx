## Update a beneficiary

Update a beneficiary's details at any time — for example, if a recipient changes their bank account, switches banks, or updates their name.

```bash
curl --request PUT \
  --url 'https://api.fincra.com/payouts/beneficiaries/{beneficiaryId}' \
  --header 'api-key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    ...
  }'
```

<Info>
  Updatable fields and the full request/response payload will be documented here once confirmed.
</Info>

<Note>
  If you're updating a beneficiary's account number, re-run [account verification](/verification/verify-a-beneficiary-account) on the new account before saving the change. This confirms the new details are valid before your next payout to that recipient.
</Note>

## Delete a beneficiary

Remove a beneficiary record when it's no longer needed:

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
  --url 'https://api.fincra.com/payouts/beneficiaries/{beneficiaryId}' \
  --header 'api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

<Info>
  Delete response and confirmation fields will be documented here once confirmed.
</Info>

<Warning>
  Deleting a beneficiary is permanent. Any payouts already sent to this beneficiary are not affected, but you will need to re-create the record if you want to pay the same recipient again in future.
</Warning>

## When to update vs delete

| Scenario | Action |
|---|---|
| Recipient changed their bank account number | **Update** — change the account number and re-verify |
| Recipient moved to a different bank | **Update** — change the bank code (get the new code from [List Banks](/payouts/create-beneficiaries#list-supported-banks-and-mobile-money-providers)) |
| Recipient's name changed | **Update** — edit the name field |
| Recipient is no longer active | **Delete** — keep your beneficiary list clean |
| Recipient switching from bank account to mobile money | **Delete** the old record, **Create** a new one with the correct method |
