Ghana supports payouts to both bank accounts and mobile money wallets in GHS.

## Bank account payouts

Send GHS to any Ghanaian bank account via local clearing rails.

- **Payment destination:** `bank_account`
- **No payment scheme required** — Fincra routes automatically.
- **Bank SWIFT code required** — Ghana uses `bankSwiftCode` instead of `bankCode` for bank identification.

## Mobile money payouts

Send GHS to mobile money wallets in Ghana.

- **Payment destination:** `mobile_money_wallet`
- **Mobile money code required** — Pass the `mobileMoneyCode` for the recipient's provider. Retrieve available providers from the List Banks endpoint.
- **Phone number format** — Use country code + number without the `+` symbol (e.g., `233241234567`).
