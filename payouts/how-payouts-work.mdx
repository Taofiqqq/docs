This page explains how Fincra Payouts work end-to-end — from funding your wallet to funds arriving in the recipient's account. Read this before you start building.

## The payout flow

Fincra uses a single, unified API for all payouts. Whether you're sending NGN to a Nigerian bank account or USD to a UK bank via SWIFT, the flow is the same — cross-currency payouts simply add a quote step.

<Note>
  **Design team:** Flow diagram needed here — visual showing the unified payout flow with two paths:

  **Same-currency path:** Fund wallet → Submit payout (with beneficiary details) → Fincra routes via local rails → Funds arrive → Webhook fires.

  **Cross-currency path:** Fund wallet → Generate quote (30s lock) → Submit payout (with quote reference) → Fincra converts + routes → Funds arrive → Webhook fires.

  Show the quote step as a conditional branch splitting from the main flow.
</Note>

### Same-currency payouts

When the source and destination currencies match (e.g., NGN → NGN, GHS → GHS):

1. **Fund your wallet** — Ensure your source currency wallet has sufficient funds.
2. **Submit the payout** — Call the Payout API with the recipient's details, amount, and `customerReference`.
3. **Fincra routes the payout** — Funds are sent via local clearing rails to the recipient's bank account or mobile money wallet.
4. **Recipient receives funds** — Settlement times vary by country and method.
5. **Webhook fires** — You receive a `payout.successful` or `payout.failed` event.

### Cross-currency payouts

When the source and destination currencies differ (e.g., NGN → GHS, USD → KES):

1. **Fund your wallet** — Ensure your source currency wallet has sufficient funds.
2. **Generate a quote** — Call the Quote API with `sourceCurrency`, `destinationCurrency`, `amount`, and `transactionType: "disbursement"`. You receive a `quoteReference` valid for **30 seconds**.
3. **Submit the payout** — Call the Payout API with the recipient's details, amount, and the `quoteReference` from step 2.
4. **Fincra converts and routes** — Funds are converted at the locked rate and routed to the recipient.
5. **Recipient receives funds** — Settlement times vary by country, method, and payment scheme.
6. **Webhook fires** — You receive a `payout.successful` or `payout.failed` event.

<Warning>
  The quote expires after **30 seconds**. If it expires before you submit the payout, generate a new quote and try again.
</Warning>

## Payout lifecycle

Every payout goes through a simple status progression:

<Note>
  **Design team:** State diagram needed here — visual showing: `processing` → `successful` or `processing` → `failed`. Keep it simple — only 3 states.
</Note>

| Status | Description |
|---|---|
| `processing` | The payout has been submitted and is being processed by Fincra and the destination bank/wallet. |
| `successful` | The payout was completed successfully. Funds have been sent to the recipient. |
| `failed` | The payout failed. Check the webhook payload for failure details. |

<Warning>
  **Only retry payouts with an explicit `failed` status.** A payout in `processing` is still in progress — do not resubmit it. If you don't receive a webhook, use the verify endpoint to check the status before taking action.
</Warning>

### Preventing duplicates

Include a `customerReference` (your own unique identifier) in every payout request. Fincra uses this to detect and reject duplicate submissions. If a payout with the same `customerReference` already exists, the API will return an error instead of creating a duplicate.

## Cross-currency quotes

For cross-currency payouts, you must generate a quote before submitting the payout. The quote locks in the exchange rate and calculates the exact amounts.

### Quote request

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.fincra.com/quotes/generate' \
--header 'api-key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "sourceCurrency": "NGN",
    "destinationCurrency": "KES",
    "amount": "50000",
    "action": "send",
    "transactionType": "disbursement",
    "business": "YOUR_BUSINESS_ID"
}'
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sourceCurrency` | string | Yes | The currency you're paying from (e.g., `NGN`). |
| `destinationCurrency` | string | Yes | The currency the recipient receives (e.g., `KES`). |
| `amount` | string | Yes | The amount in the source currency. |
| `action` | string | Yes | Use `send`. |
| `transactionType` | string | Yes | Use `disbursement` for payouts. |
| `business` | string | Yes | Your Fincra business ID. |

The response includes a `reference` field — this is the `quoteReference` you pass to the Payout API. The quote expires after **30 seconds**.

## Payment schemes

For international payouts in USD, GBP, and EUR, you must specify a payment scheme. The scheme determines how the funds are routed, how fast they arrive, and any limits that apply.

| Currency | Scheme | API value | Settlement speed |
|---|---|---|---|
| USD | ACH | `ach` | 1-3 business days |
| USD | Fedwire | `fed_wire` | Same day |
| USD | SWIFT | `swift` | 1-2 business days |
| GBP | Faster Payments (FPS) | `fps` | Within 1 hour |
| GBP | CHAPS | `chaps` | Within 1 hour |
| GBP | SWIFT | `swift` | 1-2 business days |
| EUR | SEPA | `sepa` | Within 1 day |
| EUR | SEPA Instant | `sepa_instant` | Within seconds |
| EUR | SWIFT | `swift` | 1-2 business days |

<Note>
  **CHAPS** is only available Monday–Friday, 08:00–17:00 UK time (excluding UK public holidays).
</Note>

African currency payouts (NGN, GHS, KES, UGX, ZMW, TZS, XAF, XOF, ZAR, EGP) do not require a payment scheme — Fincra automatically routes through local clearing rails.

For a deeper look at each scheme, see [Payment Schemes](/payouts/payment-schemes).

## Beneficiaries

A beneficiary is the person or organization receiving the payout. Fincra supports two types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| `individual` | A person (sole beneficiary) |
| `corporate` | An organization or company |

You can save beneficiaries for reuse — create them once and reference them in future payouts. This avoids re-entering recipient details for repeat payments. See [Beneficiaries](/payouts/beneficiaries) for details on creating and managing beneficiaries.

## Webhooks

Fincra sends webhook events for every payout:

| Event | Description |
|---|---|
| `payout.successful` | The payout completed successfully. Funds have been sent to the recipient. |
| `payout.failed` | The payout failed. The payload includes details on the failure reason. |

Listen for these events as the primary way to confirm payout outcomes. Use the verify endpoint as a backup for reconciliation. For webhook setup and signature validation, see [Webhooks](/webhooks/overview).

## Key things to know

- **Sandbox available** — Test your payout integration in sandbox before going live. Use the sandbox base URL: `https://sandbox.fincra.com`.
- **Dashboard + API** — You can send payouts manually from the [Fincra dashboard](https://dashboard.fincra.com) or programmatically via the API.
- **`customerReference` is critical** — Always include a unique `customerReference` in every payout to prevent duplicate transactions.
- **Only retry on `failed`** — Never resubmit a payout that is still `processing`. Use the verify endpoint to check status if you haven't received a webhook.
- **Quote expiry** — Cross-currency quotes expire after 30 seconds. Generate a new one if it lapses.
- **Sender details required for international** — USD, GBP, and EUR payouts require sender information (name, ID, country of origin) for compliance.
