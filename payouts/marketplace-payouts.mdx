If you run a marketplace — for e-commerce, freelance services, digital content, or gig work — Fincra's payout API lets you disburse earnings to sellers and creators across Africa and internationally.

<Note>
  Fincra does not offer a native split payments product. Your platform manages the disbursement logic: how much each seller receives, when, and in what currency. Fincra handles the actual transfer to each recipient's bank account or mobile money wallet.
</Note>

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Collect payment from the buyer">
    Accept payment from the buyer using [Fincra Payments](/payments/introduction) — via checkout, payment link, or direct charge. Funds settle into your Fincra wallet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Calculate seller earnings">
    Your platform handles the business logic: deduct your marketplace fee, apply any holds or escrow periods, and determine the net amount each seller is owed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save sellers as beneficiaries">
    Create a [beneficiary record](/payouts/create-beneficiaries) for each seller during onboarding. Store the returned beneficiary ID in your platform's seller profile — you'll reference it for every disbursement.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Disburse to each seller">
    For each seller in a settlement run, call the [Initiate Transfer](/payouts/initiate-transfer) endpoint using their saved beneficiary ID. Use `customerReference` to link the payout to the order or settlement ID in your system.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm disbursement">
    Listen for `payout.successful` and `payout.failed` webhooks per seller. Update your seller dashboard and retry any failures after investigating the cause.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **Diagram needed:** Marketplace disbursement flow — buyer pays → funds settle to platform wallet → platform applies fee logic → loop per seller → individual payout initiated → webhook received per seller → seller balance updated.
</Note>

## Recommended customerReference format

Tie each payout to a specific order and seller for clean reconciliation:

```
order-{orderId}-seller-{sellerId}

Examples:
order-ORD82910-seller-SLR004
order-ORD82910-seller-SLR017
```

## Disbursement architecture

Since Fincra processes payouts one at a time, structure your disbursement logic accordingly:

```
Order settled
      ↓
Calculate per-seller net earnings
      ↓
For each seller:
  → Retrieve beneficiary ID from seller profile
  → Generate quote (if cross-currency)
  → Initiate payout
  → Store Fincra payout reference in your records
      ↓
Webhook received → Update seller payout status
```

## Key considerations

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Your fee logic, Fincra's rails" icon="sliders">
    Fincra transfers exactly what you instruct it to. Deduct your marketplace fees before initiating each payout — Fincra does not apply any split or fee logic on your behalf.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Onboard sellers early" icon="users">
    Create beneficiary records when sellers join your platform, not at settlement time. Waiting until payout time introduces delays in your disbursement cycle.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pay in local currency" icon="globe">
    Disburse to sellers in their local currency regardless of what the buyer paid in. Fincra handles the FX through the quote flow.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Track at order level" icon="tag">
    Link each payout to a specific order and seller using `customerReference`. This makes disputes and reconciliation straightforward.
