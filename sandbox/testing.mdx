Use the values on this page to trigger specific outcomes in sandbox — success, decline, failure, and edge cases. Cover every scenario here before going live.

## Sandbox test values

The following values only work against `https://sandboxapi.fincra.com`. They have no effect in production.

### Test cards

Use these card numbers when testing payments via Checkout or the Direct Charge API. Pair with any future expiry date, any 3-digit CVV, and any cardholder name.

### Simulating specific outcomes

Sandbox outcomes are determined by the specific test card number or account number used in the request — not by the amount or any other field. Use the tables above to trigger the outcome you need.

## Production test values

There are no dedicated test values for the production environment. To validate your integration in production:

- Use real account details — your own bank account number, mobile money number, or card — to run small-value transactions.
- Start with the minimum amount your product supports to keep live test costs low.
- Confirm webhooks fire correctly and your handler returns a `200` response before scaling up.

<Note>
  Direct Debit has no sandbox environment. All Direct Debit testing must be done in production. See the [Direct Debit Integration Checklist](/direct-debit/integration-checklist) for a recommended production test sequence.
</Note>

## Common test scenarios

Cover these scenarios before going live:

| Scenario | How to test |
|---|---|
| Successful payment | Use a success test card → confirm `payment.successful` webhook fires |
| Card decline | Use a decline test card → confirm your UI shows an appropriate error |
| Insufficient funds | Use the insufficient funds test card → confirm your UI handles the error |
| 3DS required | Use the 3DS test card → confirm your checkout handles the authentication step |
| Successful payout | Initiate a payout with sandbox credentials → confirm `payout.successful` webhook |
| Failed payout | Use a failure-trigger account → confirm `payout.failed` is handled and logged |
| Insufficient wallet balance | Initiate a payout exceeding your test wallet balance |
| Expired FX quote | Wait more than 30 seconds after generating a quote before initiating the conversion |
| Duplicate `customerReference` | Submit the same reference twice → confirm only the first processes |
| Webhook signature validation | Confirm your server rejects events with an invalid signature |
| Account verification — pass | Use a test account number that returns a valid account name |
| Account verification — fail | Use a test account number that returns an error |

---

## Webhook testing

Every sandbox transaction fires the corresponding webhook event in real time. To test webhooks:

1. Set up a sandbox webhook endpoint in your dashboard — Test Mode → Settings → Webhooks
2. Use [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) if you don't have a public server endpoint yet
3. Trigger a transaction using the test values above and confirm the event arrives
4. Verify your handler processes the payload and returns a `200` response

See [Configure Webhooks](/webhooks/configure) and [Verify Webhooks](/webhooks/verify) for full setup details.
