Fincra's sandbox is a complete simulation of the production environment. Test payments, payouts, conversions, webhooks, and the full transaction lifecycle — with no real money involved.

## Getting started

Your sandbox and production accounts live in the same dashboard at [app.fincra.com](https://app.fincra.com). You don't need a separate account — use the **Test Mode** toggle at the top of the page to switch between environments.

Sandbox is available immediately after signing up. No compliance approval required. The toggle to Live Mode only becomes available once your account is verified and approved.

| | Sandbox | Production |
|---|---|---|
| **Dashboard** | [app.fincra.com](https://app.fincra.com) — Test Mode | [app.fincra.com](https://app.fincra.com) — Live Mode |
| **API Base URL** | `https://sandboxapi.fincra.com` | `https://api.fincra.com` |
| **Credentials** | Separate sandbox API key | Separate production API key |
| **Money** | Simulated — no real funds | Real transactions |

## Testing in the dashboard

Once in Test Mode, you can:

- **Fund your test wallet** — Balance tab → **Fund Balance** → select currency and amount. No real funds needed. See [Fund Your Wallet](/wallets/fund-your-wallet).
- **Simulate transactions** — initiate payouts, create payment links, trigger conversions directly from the dashboard.
- **Generate sandbox API keys** — Settings → Developer → API Keys. Sandbox keys are separate from production keys and will not work against the production API.
- **Configure test webhooks** — Settings → Webhooks → add your sandbox endpoint. Every sandbox transaction fires the corresponding webhook in real time. See [Configure Webhooks](/webhooks/configure).

## Testing via the API

**Step 1: Get your sandbox API key**

Switch to Test Mode in the dashboard, then go to **Settings → Developer → API Keys** to generate your sandbox key. Your `x-pub-key` (required for Checkout) is also environment-specific — confirm you are using the sandbox version. See [Manage API Keys](/developer-resources/manage-api-keys).

**Step 2: Make your first sandbox API call**

Pass your sandbox API key in the `api-key` header on every request. The base URL for all sandbox requests is `https://sandboxapi.fincra.com`.

```bash
curl https://sandboxapi.fincra.com/core/banks \
  -H "api-key: YOUR_SANDBOX_API_KEY"
```

**Step 3: Trigger test scenarios**

Use the test values in [Testing](/sandbox/testing) to trigger specific outcomes — success, decline, failure, and edge cases.

<Info>
  When you're ready for production, generate a production API key in Live Mode and update your base URL: `https://sandboxapi.fincra.com` → `https://api.fincra.com`.

## What you can test

| Product | Sandbox support |
|---|---|
| Payments (Checkout, Payment Links, Direct Charge API, Virtual Accounts) | ✅ Full simulation |
| Payouts (bank account, mobile money, wallet transfers) | ✅ Full simulation |
| Currency Conversion | ✅ Simulated rates |
| Webhooks | ✅ Fires on every event |
| Payment and payout status transitions | ✅ Full lifecycle |
| Wallets (create, fund, fetch, balance history) | ✅ Full simulation |
| Verification (account number, BVN, card BIN) | ✅ Full simulation |
| Direct Debit | ❌ Production only |

<Note>
  Direct Debit has no sandbox environment — testing must be done in production with small-value real transactions. See the [Direct Debit Integration Checklist](/direct-debit/integration-checklist) for guidance.
</Note>

## Going live

When you're ready to switch to production:

1. Complete compliance verification (if not already done)
2. Toggle to **Live Mode** in the dashboard
3. Generate a production API key
4. Update your base URL: `sandboxapi.fincra.com` → `api.fincra.com`
5. Configure your production webhook endpoint
6. Run a small live transaction to confirm the full flow works end-to-end
