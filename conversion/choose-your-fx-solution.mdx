Fincra provides two ways to access exchange rates for currency conversion — **Quotes** and **Rates**. They serve different purposes in your integration, and you can use both within the same account.

## At a glance

| | Quotes | Rates |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Lock in a guaranteed exchange rate before converting | Check the current exchange rate without commitment |
| **Rate guarantee** | Yes — locked for 30 seconds | No — indicative only, can change at any time |
| **Required for conversion** | Yes — every conversion needs a `quoteReference` | No — cannot be used to create a conversion directly |
| **Best for** | Executing conversions, locking in pricing | Monitoring rates, displaying pricing to users, planning |
| **Endpoint** | `POST /quotes/generate` | `GET /quotes/treasury-orders/rates` |

## Quotes

Quotes are the core of Fincra's Currency Conversion. When you generate a quote, Fincra locks in an exchange rate for **30 seconds**, giving you a guaranteed price to convert at. The response includes a `quoteReference` that you pass to the conversion endpoint to execute the trade.

**When to use Quotes:**

- You're ready to convert and want a guaranteed rate
- Your workflow requires knowing the exact conversion amount before committing (e.g., payroll, tuition payments)
- You need to show a confirmed price to your customer before executing (e.g., checkout flows, booking confirmations)

Every conversion on Fincra requires a quote. There is no way to convert without one.

## Rates

Rates give you a real-time view of exchange rates across your supported currency pairs. They're purely informational — you can't use a rate to create a conversion directly, but they're useful for building rate-aware features into your product.

**When to use Rates:**

- You want to display live exchange rates on your dashboard or app
- You're monitoring rate movements to decide the best time to convert
- You need to estimate conversion costs before committing

## Which use cases favour which?

| Use case | Recommended | Why |
|---|---|---|
| [Travel & Hospitality](/conversion/travel-and-hospitality) | **Rates** to display, **Quotes** to book | Show indicative prices to travelers, then lock the rate at booking time |
| [Payroll](/conversion/payroll) | **Quotes** | Salaries must be exact — lock the rate to guarantee the payout amount |
| [Digital Marketplaces](/conversion/digital-marketplaces) | **Rates** to estimate, **Quotes** to settle | Estimate seller payouts with rates, lock with a quote at settlement |
| [International Trade](/conversion/international-trade-settlement) | **Rates** to monitor, **Quotes** to execute | Monitor rates for a favorable window, then lock and convert |
| [Education & Tuition](/conversion/education-and-tuition-payments) | **Quotes** | Tuition is a fixed amount — lock exactly how much local currency covers the fee |

## Can I use both?

Yes. Rates and Quotes are not mutually exclusive. A common pattern is to use the Rates endpoint to monitor exchange rates in the background, then call the Quotes endpoint to lock in a rate when conditions are favorable or when a user action triggers a conversion.
