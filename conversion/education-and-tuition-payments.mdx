description: "How education platforms and payment providers use currency conversion to settle tuition in foreign currencies."

Education payments are high-stakes and fixed-amount. A student in Nigeria owes 5,000 GBP in tuition to a UK university. A payment platform processing school fees for families across Africa needs to convert local currencies to the institution's currency. In both cases, the exact amount matters — underpaying means the fee isn't covered, and overpaying creates reconciliation problems.

Fincra's Currency Conversion helps education payment platforms and businesses lock in the exact exchange rate needed to cover a tuition invoice, guaranteeing the converted amount matches what the institution requires.

## How it works

<Note>
  **Design team:** Flow diagram needed here — visual showing: Student/platform has tuition invoice in GBP → Generates quote for exact GBP amount → Quote shows exact NGN cost → Executes conversion at locked rate → GBP settles in wallet → Remits to institution.
</Note>

1. **Tuition invoice received** — The student or payment platform receives a tuition invoice denominated in a foreign currency (e.g., 5,000 GBP).
2. **Quote generated for exact amount** — The platform calls the [Quotes API](/conversion/quotes) to generate a quote converting NGN to GBP. The response shows the exact NGN amount needed to produce 5,000 GBP.
3. **Cost confirmed** — The platform or student reviews the quote — the `amountToCharge` shows the total NGN that will be debited, and `amountToReceive` confirms the GBP amount. The rate is locked for 30 seconds.
4. **Conversion executes** — The platform passes the `quoteReference` to the [conversion endpoint](/conversion/create-a-conversion) to execute the conversion at the guaranteed rate.
5. **Funds settle** — The converted GBP settles in the platform's GBP wallet within 5–10 minutes.
6. **Tuition remitted** — The platform sends the GBP to the educational institution via the [Payouts API](/payouts/overview) or bank transfer.

## Which FX solution to use

| Stage | Solution | Why |
|---|---|---|
| All stages | [Quotes](/conversion/quotes) | Tuition is a fixed amount in a specific currency. Quotes guarantee the exact conversion so the payment covers the invoice precisely. |

Rates are not recommended for tuition payments. The amount must be exact — indicative rates can shift between the time a student checks the price and the time the payment is made.

## Why this matters

- **Exact coverage** — The converted amount matches the tuition invoice exactly. No shortfall, no overpayment.
- **Transparent pricing** — Students or families see the exact local currency cost before committing, with no hidden fees on top of the conversion.
- **Fast settlement** — Funds settle in 5–10 minutes, enabling same-day tuition payments in most cases.
