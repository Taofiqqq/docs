description: "How travel platforms and hospitality businesses use currency conversion to manage multi-currency bookings."
---

Travel platforms, OTAs, and hospitality businesses deal with multi-currency pricing daily. A hotel in Lagos lists rooms in NGN, but a traveler in Nairobi wants to see prices in KES. A tour operator in Accra needs to quote safari packages in EUR for European customers. In every case, the platform needs to show accurate prices in the traveler's currency — and lock in the rate at the moment of booking to protect margins.

Fincra's Currency Conversion helps travel businesses display live exchange rates to customers and lock in a guaranteed rate at booking time, eliminating FX risk between when a price is shown and when a booking is confirmed.

## How it works

<Note>
  **Design team:** Flow diagram needed here — visual showing: Travel platform lists property in NGN → Fetches rate via Rates API → Displays KES price to traveler → Traveler books → Platform generates quote → Conversion executes at locked rate → Funds settle in NGN wallet.
</Note>

1. **Property listed in local currency** — A hotel, flight, or tour package is listed on the platform in the supplier's local currency (e.g., NGN).
2. **Platform fetches live rates** — The platform calls the [Rates API](/conversion/rates) to get the current exchange rate for KES-NGN and displays the equivalent price to the traveler in KES.
3. **Traveler initiates a booking** — The traveler sees the KES price and decides to book.
4. **Platform locks the rate** — The platform calls the [Quotes API](/conversion/quotes) to generate a quote for the exact booking amount, locking the exchange rate for 30 seconds.
5. **Conversion executes** — The platform passes the `quoteReference` to the [conversion endpoint](/conversion/create-a-conversion) to convert KES to NGN at the guaranteed rate.
6. **Funds settle** — The converted NGN settles in the platform's NGN wallet within 5–10 minutes, ready to pay the supplier.

## Which FX solution to use

| Stage | Solution | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Browsing & pricing | [Rates](/conversion/rates) | Show indicative prices to travelers without commitment. Rates update in real-time so displayed prices stay current. |
| Booking confirmation | [Quotes](/conversion/quotes) | Lock the exchange rate at the moment the traveler confirms. The 30-second quote window is enough to complete the booking flow. |

## Why this matters

- **No FX surprises** — The traveler sees one price and pays that price. No adjustments after booking.
- **Margin protection** — The platform locks the rate before confirming the booking, so currency movement between browsing and booking doesn't eat into margins.
- **Real-time pricing** — Rates update continuously, so displayed prices reflect current market conditions.
