Fincra's Currency Conversion lets you convert funds between currencies directly in your wallet. Whether you're pre-funding a wallet ahead of a payout, locking in a favorable exchange rate, or rebalancing your multi-currency balances, conversions happen in minutes with no conversion fees.

## Key benefits

- **No conversion fees** — You pay nothing extra to convert. The exchange rate you see in your quote is the rate you get.
- **Rate control** — Check live rates on demand or lock in a guaranteed rate for 30 seconds before committing.
- **Fast settlement** — Converted funds settle in your destination currency wallet within 5–10 minutes.
- **Wallet-to-wallet** — Funds move between your Fincra wallets instantly. No external transfers needed.

## Choose your FX solution

Fincra offers two ways to access exchange rates depending on your integration needs.

| I want to... | Use this | Details |
|---|---|---|
| Check the current exchange rate before deciding to convert | [Rates](/conversion/rates) | Returns the live rate for a currency pair. No lock-in. |
| Lock in a guaranteed rate and convert within a time window | [Quotes](/conversion/quotes) | Locks the rate for 30 seconds. Use the quote reference to create a conversion. |

## How it works

<Note>
  **Design team:** Flow diagram needed here — visual showing the 4-step conversion flow below (horizontal or vertical).
</Note>

1. **Fund your wallet** — Ensure your source currency wallet has sufficient funds for the conversion.
2. **Get a rate or quote** — Call the [Rates](/conversion/rates) or [Quotes](/conversion/quotes) endpoint to get the current exchange rate or lock in a guaranteed rate.
3. **Create a conversion** — Pass the quote reference to the [conversion endpoint](/conversion/create-a-conversion) to execute the conversion.
4. **Funds settle** — Converted funds appear in your destination currency wallet within 5–10 minutes.
