Quotes let you lock in an exchange rate before executing a conversion. When you generate a quote, Fincra guarantees the rate for **30 seconds** — giving you a fixed price to convert at, regardless of market movement during that window.

Every conversion on Fincra requires a quote. You cannot create a conversion without a `quoteReference`.

## How Quotes work

<Note>
  **Design team:** Flow diagram needed here — visual showing the Quotes flow: Generate quote → Receive guaranteed rate + quoteReference (30s validity) → Pass quoteReference to conversion endpoint → Conversion executes at guaranteed rate.
</Note>

1. **Generate a quote** — Call `POST /quotes/generate` with your source currency, destination currency, and the amount you want to convert (in source currency).
2. **Receive a guaranteed rate** — Fincra returns the locked exchange rate, the converted amount, and a `quoteReference`. This rate is guaranteed for 30 seconds.
3. **Create the conversion** — Pass the `quoteReference` to the conversion endpoint within the 30-second window. The conversion executes at the guaranteed rate.

If the quote expires before you create the conversion, the `quoteReference` becomes invalid. Generate a new quote and try again.

## What's in a quote response

When you generate a quote, the response includes:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `reference` | The quote reference. Pass this as `quoteReference` when creating a conversion. |
| `sourceCurrency` | The currency you are converting from. |
| `destinationCurrency` | The currency you are converting to. |
| `sourceAmount` | The amount being converted (in source currency). |
| `destinationAmount` | The amount you will receive (in destination currency). |
| `rate` | The full exchange rate. |
| `price` | The rounded exchange rate. |
| `fee` | The conversion fee. Always `0` — Fincra does not charge conversion fees. |
| `amountToCharge` | The total amount debited from your source currency wallet. |
| `amountToReceive` | The total amount credited to your destination currency wallet. |
| `expireAt` | The timestamp when this quote expires. |
| `settlementDate` | The expected settlement date for the conversion. |

## When to use Quotes

- **Every conversion** — Quotes are required. There is no way to convert without one.
- **Price-sensitive workflows** — Lock the rate when you need to show your customer an exact amount before committing (e.g., checkout, booking confirmation, tuition payment).
- **Batch planning** — Generate quotes for multiple conversions to preview exact costs before executing.

## Pricing

There are no separate fees for quotes or conversions. The exchange rate returned in the quote is the all-in rate — what you see is what you get.

## Key things to know

- **30-second validity** — Quotes expire after 30 seconds. If you don't create a conversion within this window, generate a new quote.
- **Amount is in source currency** — The `amount` field in your request represents the source currency amount you want to convert.
- **One quote, one conversion** — Each `quoteReference` can only be used for a single conversion.
- **`action` is always `send`** — For conversion quotes, the `action` field is always set to `send`.
- **`transactionType` is always `conversion`** — This distinguishes conversion quotes from other quote types.
