Use this step-by-step guide to create a currency conversion between two currencies in your Fincra wallet using the Currency Conversion APIs. For conversions that happen as part of a cross-currency payout, see [Create a Payout](/payouts/overview).

## Prerequisites

Before you create a conversion, ensure the following:

- **Authentication** — You have a valid API key. See [Manage API Keys](/developer-resources/manage-api-keys).
- **Funded wallet** — Your source currency wallet has sufficient funds to cover the conversion amount.
- **Supported currency pair** — The source and destination currencies you want to convert between are supported. See [Supported Currency Pairs](/conversion/supported-currency-pairs).
- **Business ID** — You have your Fincra business ID, available from your dashboard.

## Step 1: Get the current exchange rate

<Note>
  This step is optional. If you already know the rate you want and are ready to convert, skip to [Step 2](#step-2-lock-in-a-quote).
</Note>

Before committing to a conversion, you can check the live exchange rate for a currency pair using the Rates endpoint. This is useful for monitoring rates, displaying pricing to your users, or deciding when to convert.

### Request

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.fincra.com/quotes/treasury-orders/rates?currencyPair=USD-NGN' \
--header 'api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `currencyPair` | query | Either this or `currency` | The currency pair to get the rate for, formatted as `SOURCE-DESTINATION` (e.g., `USD-NGN`). |
| `currency` | query | Either this or `currencyPair` | A single currency code to get all available rates for that currency (e.g., `USD`). |

### Response

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Rates retrieved successfully",
    "data": {
        "rates": [
            {
                "baseCurrency": "USD",
                "quoteCurrency": "NGN",
                "side": "buy",
                "price": 1380.85
            },
            {
                "baseCurrency": "USD",
                "quoteCurrency": "NGN",
                "side": "sell",
                "price": 1388.74
            }
        ],
        "pagination": {
            "page": 1,
            "perPage": 10,
            "totalItems": 2,
            "totalPages": 1,
            "timestamp": "2026-02-16T15:39:56.424Z"
        }
    }
}
```

The response returns both `buy` and `sell` rates for the requested pair. Rates are real-time and update continuously.

<Warning>
  Rates returned by this endpoint are indicative and not guaranteed. To lock in a rate for conversion, proceed to Step 2.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Lock in a quote

Generate a quote to lock in an exchange rate for your conversion. The quote is valid for **30 seconds** by default. You'll receive a `quoteReference` that you'll use in the next step to execute the conversion.

### Request

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.fincra.com/quotes/generate' \
--header 'api-key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "sourceCurrency": "KES",
    "destinationCurrency": "NGN",
    "action": "send",
    "transactionType": "conversion",
    "amount": "2",
    "business": "YOUR_BUSINESS_ID"
}'
```

### Request body

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sourceCurrency` | string | Yes | The currency you are converting from (e.g., `KES`). |
| `destinationCurrency` | string | Yes | The currency you are converting to (e.g., `NGN`). |
| `action` | string | Yes | The action type. Use `send` for conversions. |
| `transactionType` | string | Yes | The transaction type. Use `conversion`. |
| `amount` | string | Yes | The amount to convert. |
| `business` | string | Yes | Your Fincra business ID. |

### Response

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Quote generated successfully",
    "data": {
        "sourceCurrency": "KES",
        "destinationCurrency": "NGN",
        "sourceAmount": 2,
        "destinationAmount": 21.4,
        "action": "send",
        "transactionType": "conversion",
        "fee": 0,
        "initialAmount": 2,
        "quotedAmount": 21.4,
        "rate": 10.6998542306,
        "amountToCharge": 2,
        "amountToReceive": 21.4,
        "price": 10.7,
        "reference": "2b3e6890-8fc6-4c6d-b573-6f3591fec898",
        "expireAt": "2026-02-16T15:42:11.452Z",
        "rounding": null,
        "settlementDate": "2026-02-16T15:41:41.430Z"
    }
}
```

The `reference` field is the `quoteReference` you'll use in the next step. The `amountToCharge` is the total debited from your source wallet, and `amountToReceive` is what you'll get in the destination wallet.

<Warning>
  Save the `reference` from the response — you'll pass it as `quoteReference` when creating the conversion. The quote expires after **30 seconds**. If it expires, generate a new quote and try again.
</Warning>

## Step 3: Execute the conversion

With your `quoteReference` in hand, call the Create Conversion endpoint to execute the conversion. Fincra will debit the source currency from your wallet and credit the destination currency.

### Request

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.fincra.com/conversions/initiate' \
--header 'api-key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "business": "YOUR_BUSINESS_ID",
    "quoteReference": "2b3e6890-8fc6-4c6d-b573-6f3591fec898",
    "customerReference": "your-internal-reference-123"
}'
```

### Request body

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `business` | string | Yes | Your Fincra business ID. |
| `quoteReference` | string | Yes | The quote reference returned in Step 2. |
| `customerReference` | string | Yes | Your own unique reference for this conversion. Use this to reconcile conversions in your system. |

### Response

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Conversion initiated successfully",
    "data": {
        "_id": 55070,
        "id": 55070,
        "reference": "8a16de68-28d4-418e-ab81-3444fbb9cbe1",
        "customerReference": "your-internal-reference-123"
    }
}
```

The conversion has been initiated. Save the `reference` — you'll use it to verify the conversion status. The conversion will settle in your destination currency wallet within **5–10 minutes**.

## Step 4: Verify the conversion

After initiating a conversion, you can verify its status using the conversion reference. This is useful as a backup to webhooks or for reconciliation.

### Request

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.fincra.com/conversions/reference/YOUR_CONVERSION_REFERENCE' \
--header 'api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

### Response

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Conversion fetched successfully",
    "data": {
        "id": 55070,
        "_id": "55070",
        "amountCharged": 2,
        "amountReceived": 21.4,
        "sourceCurrency": "KES",
        "destinationCurrency": "NGN",
        "sourceFee": 0,
        "destinationFee": 0,
        "settlementDate": "2026-02-16T15:41:41.000Z",
        "settledAt": "2026-02-16T15:42:00.000Z",
        "sourceExchangeRate": 0.0934579439,
        "destinationExchangeRate": 10.6998542306,
        "status": "successful",
        "reference": "8a16de68-28d4-418e-ab81-3444fbb9cbe1",
        "isSubAccount": 0,
        "description": null,
        "settlementDestination": "wallet",
        "customerReference": "your-internal-reference-123",
        "message": "Conversion Successful",
        "price": 10.7,
        "createdAt": "2026-02-16T15:41:51.000Z",
        "updatedAt": "2026-02-16T15:42:00.000Z"
    }
}
```

Key fields to check:
- `status` — The conversion status. `successful` means funds have settled.
- `amountCharged` — The amount debited from your source currency wallet.
- `amountReceived` — The amount credited to your destination currency wallet.
- `settlementDestination` — Where funds were settled (always `wallet`).

<Note>
  You can also list all conversions for your business:

  ```bash
  curl --location 'https://api.fincra.com/conversions?business=YOUR_BUSINESS_ID' \
  --header 'api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'
  ```

  ```json
  {
      "success": true,
      "message": "Conversions fetched successfully",
      "data": {
          "results": [
              {
                  "id": 55070,
                  "_id": "55070",
                  "amountCharged": 2,
                  "amountReceived": 21.4,
                  "sourceCurrency": "KES",
                  "destinationCurrency": "NGN",
                  "fee": 0,
                  "settlementDate": "2026-02-16T15:41:41.000Z",
                  "settledAt": "2026-02-16T15:42:00.000Z",
                  "sourceExchangeRate": 0.0934579439,
                  "destinationExchangeRate": 10.6998542306,
                  "status": "successful",
                  "reference": "8a16de68-28d4-418e-ab81-3444fbb9cbe1",
                  "price": 10.7,
                  "createdAt": "2026-02-16T15:41:51.000Z",
                  "updatedAt": "2026-02-16T15:42:00.000Z"
              }
          ],
          "total": 17
      }
  }
  ```
</Note>

## Webhooks

Fincra sends a `conversion.successful` webhook event when a conversion has been processed and funds have settled in your destination currency wallet. We recommend listening for this event rather than polling the verification endpoint.

For details on setting up and validating webhooks, see [Webhooks](/webhooks/overview).
