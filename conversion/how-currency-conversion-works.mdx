Fincra Currency Conversion is a wallet-to-wallet FX product. You convert funds from one currency to another within your Fincra wallets — no external transfers involved. This page explains the conversion flow, how rates and quotes work, and what happens after you execute a conversion.

## Conversion flow

Every conversion follows the same core flow, whether you use the dashboard or the API.

<Note>
  **Design team:** Flow diagram needed here — visual showing the conversion flow: Fund wallet → Get quote → Create conversion → Funds settle. Show both dashboard and API paths if possible.
</Note>

### Via dashboard

1. Log in to your Fincra dashboard and navigate to the **Conversion** tab.
2. Click the **Convert** button.
3. Select your source currency and destination currency.
4. A quote is generated automatically with the current exchange rate and amount.
5. Click **Convert** to execute the conversion.

If the quote expires (after 30 seconds), a new quote is generated automatically — you don't need to do anything.

### Via API

1. **Generate a quote** — Call the Quotes endpoint with your source currency, destination currency, and amount. You'll receive a `quoteReference` and a locked exchange rate.
2. **Create a conversion** — Pass the `quoteReference` to the Create Conversion endpoint to execute the conversion.

If the quote expires before you create the conversion, the API will return a quote expired error. You'll need to generate a new quote and try again.

<Warning>
  A `quoteReference` is always required to create a conversion. There is no way to convert without first generating a quote.
</Warning>

## Rates and quotes

Fincra provides real-time exchange rates that update continuously. When you're ready to convert, you lock in a rate by generating a quote.

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| **Rate** | The current exchange rate for a currency pair. Rates are real-time and change continuously. Use the Rates endpoint to check the current rate before committing. |
| **Quote** | A locked exchange rate with a guaranteed price. Valid for **30 seconds** by default. Use the `quoteReference` from the quote to create a conversion within the validity window. |


### How the exchange rate works

Fincra's exchange rates are competitive and updated in real-time. There are no separate conversion fees — the rate you see in your quote is the all-in rate you pay.

## Settlement

Once you execute a conversion, the funds settle in your destination currency wallet within **5–10 minutes**. There is no manual step required after creating the conversion — settlement is automatic.

| Step | What happens |
|---|---|
| Conversion created | Source currency is debited from your wallet immediately. |
| Processing | Fincra processes the conversion. |
| Settled | Destination currency is credited to your wallet. Total time: 5–10 minutes. |

## Webhooks

Fincra sends a webhook notification when your conversion completes. Use this to update your records, trigger downstream actions, or confirm the conversion in your system.

| Event | Description |
|---|---|
| `conversion.successful` | Fired when a conversion has been processed and funds have settled in your destination currency wallet. |

For full details on setting up and validating webhooks, see [Webhooks](/webhooks/overview).

## Key things to know

- **Pre-funding required** — You must have sufficient funds in your source currency wallet before converting. Fincra does not offer credit or post-funding for conversions.
- **No same-currency conversions** — Source and destination currencies must be different.
- **No cancellations or amendments** — Once a conversion is executed, it cannot be reversed or modified.
- **Supported currency pairs** — Not all currency combinations are available. See [Supported Currency Pairs](/conversion/supported-currency-pairs) for the full list.
