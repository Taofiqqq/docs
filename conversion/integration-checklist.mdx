Use this checklist to verify your Currency Conversion integration in sandbox before going live in production.

## Test in sandbox

### API keys

- [ ] Log in to the [Fincra sandbox dashboard](https://sandbox.fincra.com) and generate your sandbox API key. See [Manage API Keys](/developer-resources/manage-api-keys).
- [ ] Note your sandbox business ID — you'll need it for quote and conversion requests.

### Integration

Use the sandbox base URL for all API calls during testing:

```
https://sandbox.fincra.com
```

Work through the full conversion flow:

- [ ] **Fetch a rate** — Call `GET /quotes/treasury-orders/rates` with a supported currency pair and confirm you receive `buy` and `sell` prices.
- [ ] **Generate a quote** — Call `POST /quotes/generate` with `sourceCurrency`, `destinationCurrency`, `amount`, `action`, `transactionType`, and `business`. Confirm you receive a `reference` and `expireAt` timestamp.
- [ ] **Create a conversion** — Pass the `quoteReference` to `POST /conversions/initiate` within 30 seconds. Confirm the conversion is initiated and you receive a conversion `reference`.
- [ ] **Verify a conversion** — Call `GET /conversions/reference/{reference}` and confirm the conversion status and amounts are correct.
- [ ] **List conversions** — Call `GET /conversions?business={businessId}` and confirm your test conversions appear in the results.

<Note>
  Sandbox uses mock exchange rates, not live market rates. Conversion flows and response structures are identical to production, but the rates and amounts are for testing only.
</Note>

### Error handling

- [ ] Test with an expired or invalid `quoteReference` and confirm your integration handles the `QUOTE_EXPIRED` error.
- [ ] Test with a missing required field and confirm your integration handles `VALIDATION_FAILED` errors.
- [ ] Test with an unsupported currency pair and confirm your integration handles the `INVALID_CURRENCY_PAIR` error.

See [Error Codes](/conversion/error-codes) for the full list of error types and recommended next steps.

### Webhooks

- [ ] Configure a webhook URL in the [sandbox dashboard](https://sandbox.fincra.com). See [Configure Webhooks](/webhooks/configure).
- [ ] Create a test conversion and confirm you receive the `conversion.successful` webhook event.
- [ ] Validate the webhook signature to verify the payload is from Fincra. See [Verify Webhooks](/webhooks/verify).

## Go live in production

Currency Conversion is available to all verified Fincra accounts — no separate activation is required.

### API keys

- [ ] Log in to the [Fincra production dashboard](https://dashboard.fincra.com) and generate your production API key.
- [ ] Note your production business ID.

### Switch endpoints

Update your base URL from sandbox to production:

```
https://api.fincra.com
```

- [ ] Update the base URL in your integration.
- [ ] Update your API key to the production key.

### Webhooks

- [ ] Configure your production webhook URL in the [production dashboard](https://dashboard.fincra.com). See [Configure Webhooks](/webhooks/configure).
- [ ] Verify that `conversion.successful` events are received and handled correctly.

### Verify

- [ ] Run a live conversion for a small amount to confirm the full flow works end-to-end in production.
- [ ] Confirm funds settle in the destination currency wallet.
- [ ] Confirm the webhook fires and your system processes it correctly.
