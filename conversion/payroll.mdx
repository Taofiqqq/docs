---

Businesses with employees or contractors across multiple countries need to pay salaries in each person's local currency. A company headquartered in Nigeria may hold funds in NGN but needs to pay team members in GHS, KES, and USD. The amounts must be exact — an employee expecting 500 USD cannot receive 498 USD because the rate shifted between approval and execution.

Fincra's Currency Conversion lets businesses lock in exchange rates for each currency before executing payroll, guaranteeing that every employee receives the exact amount they're owed.

## How it works

<Note>
  **Design team:** Flow diagram needed here — visual showing: Business holds NGN in wallet → Payroll date approaches → Generates quote for each currency (NGN→GHS, NGN→KES, NGN→USD) → Executes conversions at locked rates → Funds settle in destination wallets → Disburses via Payouts API.
</Note>

1. **Business holds funds in source currency** — The company has funds in their Fincra NGN wallet to cover the payroll run.
2. **Payroll amounts finalized** — The business calculates how much each employee is owed in their local currency and determines the total amount needed per currency.
3. **Quotes generated per currency** — The business calls the [Quotes API](/conversion/quotes) for each currency pair (e.g., NGN-GHS, NGN-KES, NGN-USD), locking in the exact exchange rate and conversion amount.
4. **Conversions executed** — For each quote, the business passes the `quoteReference` to the [conversion endpoint](/conversion/create-a-conversion) to execute the conversion at the guaranteed rate.
5. **Funds settle in destination wallets** — The converted amounts settle in the respective currency wallets within 5–10 minutes.
6. **Payouts disbursed** — The business uses the [Payouts API](/payouts/overview) to send funds from each currency wallet to employees in their local currency.

## Which FX solution to use

| Stage | Solution | Why |
|---|---|---|
| All stages | [Quotes](/conversion/quotes) | Salaries are fixed amounts. Quotes guarantee the exact conversion amount so every employee receives what they're owed. |

Rates are not recommended for payroll. Indicative rates can shift between the time you calculate payroll and the time you execute — Quotes eliminate that risk.

## Why this matters

- **Exact amounts** — Employees receive the precise salary amount in their local currency. No rounding surprises.
- **Multi-currency in one run** — Convert to multiple currencies in a single payroll cycle by generating a quote for each.
- **No conversion fees** — The exchange rate in the quote is the all-in rate. No hidden fees on top of the conversion.
