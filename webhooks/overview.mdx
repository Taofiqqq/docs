Webhooks allow Fincra to send real-time notifications to your application when events occur on your account. This is essential for asynchronous operations where the outcome is not available in the initial API response; for example, **collection confirmations**, **disbursement completions**, or **conversion settlements**.

By configuring a webhook URL, you can avoid having to continously poll API endpoints for status changes. Instead, Fincra pushes event data directly to your server as soon as the event occurs. For more information on webhook configuration, see [Configure and manage webhooks](/webhooks/configure).

### Why Webhooks matter

#### State management

Webhooks allow you to keep your system in sync with Fincra. When the status of a transaction changes on Fincra; for example, a payout moves from processing to successful, a webhook notifies your application so you can update the corresponding record in your database accordingly.

#### Handling asynchronous operations

Many operations in Fincra are asynchronous, the final status is not available immediately when you make the API request. For example, when you initiate a payout, confirmation that the funds were delivered may take time. Webhooks solve this by notifying your application with the final outcome as soon as it is available, so you don't need to poll the API for status changes.

### Domain and IP Allowlisting

Webhooks from Fincra are sent from the following IP addresses. If your firewall or infrastructure restricts inbound requests, you will need to allowlist these IPs to ensure webhook delivery from us.

**Production**

- 54.166.76.174

**Sandbox**

- 54.165.5.176

You can verify that a webhook event originated from Fincra by checking the source IP address in the `x-forwarded-for` request header against the addresses listed above.

> Note: These IP addresses are subject to change. We recommend checking this page periodically or subscribing to our changelog for updates.
