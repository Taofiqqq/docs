Delivery issues typically fall into two categories:

- Fincra cannot reach your webhook endpoint
- Your network connectivity is intermittent

If you're having issues with webhook delivery or validation, review the possible causes and solutions below.

## I didn't receive my webhook

### Cause

Fincra sends webhook notifications within 60 seconds of the associated event. Your server must respond with an `HTTP 2xx` status code to acknowledge successful delivery. Unsuccessful deliveries are retried for up to 2 hours.

### Retry behaviour

Fincra uses a two-phase retry strategy for `5xx` server errors:

| Phase            | Duration    | Retry interval   |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| Aggressive retry | ~10 minutes | Every 30 seconds |
| Extended retry   | ~2 hours    | Every 10 minutes |

> **Note:** Only 5xx errors trigger automatic retries. 4xx client errors, timeouts, and connection failures are not retried.

### Solution

Verify that your application responds to webhook deliveries promptly with an `HTTP 2xx` status code.

## I cannot validate a webhook notification

### Cause

The signature in the request header doesn't match what your server computed.

### Solution

Verify you're using the correct webhook secret key and following the signature validation steps in [Securing your webhooks](#).

## Webhook delivery errors

| Status             | Description                                                              | Fix                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unable to connect  | Fincra cannot establish a connection to your server.                     | Ensure your endpoint is publicly accessible.                               |
| 3xx (redirect)     | Your server redirected the request. Fincra treats redirects as failures. | Set your webhook URL to the final destination, not a redirect.             |
| 4xx (client error) | Your server rejected the request (e.g., 401, 403, 404).                  | Ensure your endpoint is public, accepts POST requests, and the URL exists. |
| 5xx (server error) | Your server encountered an error processing the request.                 | Check your application logs to identify the issue.                         |
| TLS error          | Fincra couldn't establish a secure connection.                           | Verify your SSL/TLS certificate is valid and properly configured.          |
| Timeout            | Your server took too long to respond.                                    | Respond immediately with 2xx, then process the webhook asynchronously.     |
