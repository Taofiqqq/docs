Webhooks are configured via the Fincra Dashboard. Your webhook URL must use HTTPS with a valid SSL certificate (e.g., https://yourdomain.com/webhooks).

To process webhooks, you need to:

### Expose an endpoint on your server

Your server must expose a webhook endpoint that can:

- Accept POST requests over HTTPS
- Respond with a 2xx HTTP status code within **20** seconds
- Parse incoming JSON payloads
- Store the event data before processing

Your application needs at least one reachable endpoint to receive webhook events from Fincra.

### Set up webhooks in your Dashboard

To configure a webhook on your Fincra account:

1. Log in to your Fincra Dashboard and go to **Profile > My Account**.

### Accept webhook events

Your endpoint must respond with a 2xx HTTP status code within 20 seconds of receiving a webhook event. If Fincra does not receive a
successful response, for example, your server is down or times out, the event is added to the retry queue.

You should also verify that incoming webhooks originated from Fincra before processing them. See [Webhook Verification](/webhooks/verify).

For details on event types and payloads, see [Payload Structure](/webhooks/payload) and [Events Reference](/webhooks/events).

### Test and go live

Before going live, verify that your endpoint can receive and process webhook events from Fincra.

1. Ensure your webhook URL is configured in your sandbox Dashboard.
2. Send a test event using the POST /sandbox/webhooks/test endpoint.
3. Confirm that your server received the event and responded with a 2xx status code.

The test event sends a realistic payload to your configured webhook URL and returns the delivery result, including the HTTP status code
your endpoint returned.

### Update your webhook URL

To update your webhook URL, go to Profile > My Account in your Fincra Dashboard, select the API Key and Webhooks tab, and enter the new  
 URL. Click Save Changes to apply.

After updating, send a test event to confirm the new endpoint is receiving webhook events.
