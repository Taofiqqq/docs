---

The Direct Charge API gives you complete control over the payment experience. Instead of redirecting customers to Fincra's UI or embedding a modal, you build your own interface and trigger charges directly through the API.

**Best for:** Businesses that need a fully custom payment flow — your own forms, your own UX, your own logic.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initiate a charge">
    Send the transaction details and customer's payment data to the initiate charge endpoint. Fincra returns a charge object.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize if required">
    Depending on the payment method, the customer may need to authenticate the transaction:
    - **Card** — may require OTP verification or 3D Secure (3DS) authentication
    - **Mobile Money** — customer receives a prompt on their mobile device to confirm the payment
    - **Bank Transfer, PayAttitude, PalmPay, EFT** — no additional authorization step
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify the charge">
    Always verify the charge status server-side before delivering your product or service.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Access and requirements

Direct Charge is not enabled by default. To request access:

1. Email [compliance@fincra.com](mailto:compliance@fincra.com) with your business details and intended use case.

<Warning>
  To process **card payments** via Direct Charge, your business must be **PCI-DSS compliant**. This is a hard requirement — card data passes through your system when using this API, which triggers PCI-DSS scope. Contact your account manager if you need guidance on PCI-DSS certification.
