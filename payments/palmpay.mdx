PalmPay is a Nigerian digital wallet and payment app with a large user base. Customers pay directly from their PalmPay balance — fast, seamless, and no bank details required.

## Availability

| Currency | Country | Available via |

## How it works

**Via Checkout (Hosted Payment Page or Drop-in):**

1. Customer selects **PalmPay** on the checkout page.
2. Customer is prompted to authenticate using their PalmPay credentials.
3. The payment is approved from their PalmPay wallet balance.
4. Fincra confirms the payment and marks it as successful.
5. Your wallet is credited and a `charge.successful` webhook fires.

**Via Direct Charge API:**

Use `"type": "palmpay"` in your charge request.

```json
{
  "type": "palmpay",
  "amount": 5000,
  "currency": "NGN",
  "customer": {
    "name": "Amara Okonkwo",
    "email": "amara@example.com"
  }
}
```

## Settlement

PalmPay payments settle **instantly** into your Fincra NGN wallet.
