PayAttitude is a USSD-based payment method available to Nigerian bank customers. Customers dial a USSD code on any mobile phone — smartphone or feature phone — to authorise payment directly from their bank account. No internet connection required.

## Availability

| Currency | Country | Available via |
|---|---|---|
| NGN | Nigeria | Checkout (HPP, Drop-in), Direct Charge |

## How it works

**Via Checkout (Hosted Payment Page or Drop-in):**

1. Customer selects **PayAttitude** on the checkout page.
2. Customer dials the USSD code displayed (e.g., `*322*0#`) on their phone.
3. They follow the prompts to authenticate and approve the payment.
4. Fincra confirms the payment and marks it as successful.
5. Your wallet is credited and a `charge.successful` webhook fires.

**Via Direct Charge API:**

Use `"type": "payAttitude"` in your charge request. The customer will be prompted to complete the USSD flow on their phone.

```json
{
  "type": "payAttitude",
  "amount": 5000,
  "currency": "NGN",
  "customer": {
    "name": "Amara Okonkwo",
    "email": "amara@example.com"
  }
}
```

## Settlement

PayAttitude payments settle **instantly** into your Fincra NGN wallet.

## When to use PayAttitude

PayAttitude is particularly valuable when:
- Your customers may not have smartphones or data access
- You want to maximise payment method coverage for Nigerian customers
- You are serving customers in areas with poor internet connectivity

For customers with internet access and smartphones, [Bank Transfer](/payments/bank-transfer) and [Cards](/payments/cards) may be preferred.
