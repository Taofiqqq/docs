The Hosted Payment Page is the fastest way to start accepting payments. Your server makes one API call to generate a checkout link, and you redirect your customer to it. Fincra handles the entire payment UI — your customer completes their payment and is redirected back to your site when done.

**Best for:** Businesses that want to get up and running quickly without building a custom payment UI.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Your server creates a payment">
    Make a `POST` request to the Fincra checkout endpoint with the payment details. Fincra returns a hosted checkout URL.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Redirect your customer">
    Send your customer to the checkout URL. They select their preferred payment method and complete the payment on Fincra's secure page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customer is redirected back">
    After payment, Fincra redirects your customer to your `redirectUrl` with the transaction reference appended as a query parameter.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify the payment">
    Use the transaction reference to verify the payment status server-side before delivering your product or service.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive a webhook">
    Fincra sends a `charge.successful` webhook to your server when the payment is confirmed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Always verify the payment server-side using the verify endpoint. Never rely solely on the redirect to confirm a successful payment.
</Note>

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": true,
  "message": "Hosted link generated",
  "data": {
    "link": "https://checkout.fincra.com/pay/fcr-p-2fe90fa19d",
    "reference": "order-001",
    "payCode": "fcr-p-2fe90fa19d"
  }
}
```

| Field       | Description                                                                                   |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `link`      | The URL to redirect your customer to.                                                         |
| `reference` | The transaction reference. If you didn't provide one, this matches `payCode`.                 |
| `payCode`   | Fincra's internal payment code for this session.                                              |

Redirect your customer to the `link` URL immediately. The checkout session will expire if the customer takes too long.

### Restricting payment methods

By default, Fincra shows all payment methods available for the selected currency. Use `paymentMethods` to restrict which methods are displayed.

```json
{
  "paymentMethods": ["card"]
}
```

Available values per currency:

| Currency | Available values                                      |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| NGN      | `card`, `bank_transfer`, `payAttitude`, `palmpay`     |
| KES      | `mobile_money`                                        |
| GHS      | `mobile_money`                                        |
| UGX      | `mobile_money`                                        |
| ZMW      | `card`, `mobile_money`                                |
| TZS      | `mobile_money`                                        |
| ZAR      | `card`, `eft`                                         |
| XAF      | `mobile_money`                                        |
| XOF      | `mobile_money`                                        |
| USD      | `card`                                                |

## 2. Redirect your customer

After you receive the `link` in the response, redirect your customer to it. Fincra handles the full payment experience from here — method selection, authentication, and confirmation.

If no `redirectUrl` was provided, the customer sees a confirmation message on Fincra's page after payment and is not redirected.

## 3. Verify the payment

When your customer is redirected back to your `redirectUrl`, the transaction reference is appended as a query parameter:

```
https://yoursite.com/payment/complete?reference=order-001
```

Use this reference to verify the payment status server-side before delivering any value.

<Warning>
  Visiting the `redirectUrl` does not confirm a successful payment. Always verify server-side.
</Warning>

You can verify by Fincra reference or your own merchant reference:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="By Fincra reference">
    ```bash
    curl --request GET \
      --url https://api.fincra.com/checkout-core/charges/reference/fcr-p-2fe90fa19d \
      --header 'api-key: <YOUR_SECRET_KEY>'
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="By merchant reference">
    ```bash
    curl --request GET \
      --url https://api.fincra.com/checkout-core/charges/merchant-reference/order-001 \
      --header 'api-key: <YOUR_SECRET_KEY>'
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Check the `status` field in the response before delivering your product or service:

| Status      | Meaning                                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `success`   | Payment completed. Safe to deliver.                 |
| `pending`   | Payment not yet completed. Do not deliver yet.      |
| `failed`    | Payment failed or was abandoned.                    |

## 4. Handle the webhook

Fincra sends a `charge.successful` webhook to your configured webhook URL when a payment completes. Always use the webhook as your primary confirmation signal — it fires even when the customer closes their browser before being redirected.

```json
{
  "event": "charge.successful",
  "data": {
    "id": 1093510,
    "reference": "fcr-p-2fe90fa19d",
    "merchantReference": "order-001",
    "amount": 10000,
    "amountReceived": 10000,
    "amountToSettle": 9750,
    "currency": "NGN",
    "fee": 250,
    "status": "success",
    "type": "bank_transfer",
    "feeBearer": "business",
    "settlementDestination": "wallet",
    "customer": {
      "name": "Amara Okonkwo",
      "email": "amara@example.com",
      "phoneNumber": null
    },
    "metadata": {}
  }
}
```

| Field                  | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `event`                | The webhook event type. Always `charge.successful`.          |
| `data.reference`       | Fincra's internal reference for the transaction.             |
| `data.merchantReference` | The reference you provided when creating the payment.      |
| `data.amount`          | The amount that was charged.                                 |
| `data.amountReceived`  | The actual amount received (relevant for bank transfers).    |
| `data.amountToSettle`  | The amount that will settle into your wallet after fees.     |
| `data.fee`             | The transaction fee.                                         |
| `data.status`          | Payment status. `success` on this event.                     |
| `data.type`            | The payment method used. e.g. `bank_transfer`, `card`.       |
| `data.feeBearer`       | Who bore the fee. `business` or `customer`.                  |
| `data.customer`        | Customer details passed when creating the payment.           |

For full webhook setup and signature verification, see [Webhooks](/webhooks/overview).

## Sandbox testing

Use your sandbox API keys and the sandbox base URL to test payments without real money:

```
https://sandboxapi.fincra.com/checkout-core/payments
```

The checkout link returned will point to the sandbox checkout environment. Use Fincra's [test card and account numbers](/sandbox/testing) to simulate different payment outcomes.
