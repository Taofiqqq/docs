Virtual Accounts are unique bank account numbers assigned to your business or your customers. When a customer transfers funds into a virtual account, the payment is automatically matched and your Fincra wallet is credited.

**Best for:** Businesses that want to accept bank transfers without building a checkout UI — wallets, savings apps, investment platforms, and any product where customers fund accounts directly.

## Main vs additional accounts

Every currency has a **main** virtual account and unlimited **additional** accounts.

| Type | Description | Created |
|---|---|---|
| `main` | The first virtual account created for a currency. Used to top up your own Fincra wallet balance. | On request |
| `additional` | Any subsequent virtual account for the same currency. Issued to your customers. Payments settle into your wallet. | On request via API or dashboard |

<Note>
  All virtual accounts — main and additional — settle funds into your Fincra wallet. Virtual accounts do not hold a balance of their own.
</Note>

## Temporary vs permanent accounts

For NGN, Fincra offers two account types:

| Type | Duration | Use case | Created via |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Permanent** | Static, never expires | Assign one account per customer for recurring payments | API or dashboard |
| **Temporary** | Expires at a time you set | One-time payments at checkout | API only |

For all other currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, KES, TZS), only **permanent** virtual accounts are available.

## Supported currencies
