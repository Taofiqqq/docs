Bank Transfer lets customers pay by sending a direct transfer from their bank account. Fincra generates a virtual account number for the transaction — the customer transfers the exact amount into it, and your wallet is credited automatically.

## Supported currencies

## How it works

**Via Checkout (Hosted Payment Page or Drop-in):**

1. Customer selects **Bank Transfer** on the checkout page.
2. Fincra generates a temporary virtual account with the customer's exact payment amount.
3. The customer transfers the exact amount to the account within the time window.
4. Fincra confirms the transfer and marks the payment as successful.
5. Your wallet is credited and a `charge.successful` webhook fires.

**Via Direct Charge API:**

Fincra returns a virtual account in the charge response for the customer to transfer into. Poll the verify endpoint or listen for the webhook to confirm when the transfer arrives.

**Via Virtual Accounts:**

Customers transfer directly into a permanent or temporary virtual account assigned to them. Suitable for wallet funding or recurring deposits. See [NGN Virtual Accounts](/payments/ngn-virtual-accounts).

## Settlement

Bank Transfer payments settle **instantly** into your Fincra wallet.

## Important notes

- The customer must transfer the **exact amount**. Shortfalls or excess payments may cause the transaction to fail or require manual handling.
- Temporary virtual accounts generated by the Checkout have an expiry window. If the customer does not transfer within that window, the payment session expires.
- The `virtualAccount` object in the `charge.successful` webhook contains the payer's bank details — use these for reconciliation.
