Always verify a payment server-side before delivering value to your customer. Fincra provides three endpoints for verifying a payment — use whichever fits your flow.

These endpoints work across all payment types: [Hosted Payment Page](/payments/hosted-payment-page), [Drop-in Checkout](/payments/drop-in-checkout), [Direct Charge API](/payments/accept-a-payment), and [Virtual Accounts](/payments/virtual-accounts).

## Verify endpoints

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="By Fincra reference">
    Use this when you have Fincra's internal reference — returned in the checkout response as `reference` or `payCode`.

    **Endpoint:** `GET /checkout-core/charges/reference/:reference`

    ```bash
    curl --request GET \
      --url https://api.fincra.com/checkout-core/charges/reference/fcr-p-2fe90fa19d \
      --header 'api-key: <YOUR_SECRET_KEY>'
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="By merchant reference">
    Use this when you have your own reference — the one you passed when creating the payment.

    **Endpoint:** `GET /checkout-core/charges/merchant-reference/:merchantReference`

    ```bash
    curl --request GET \
      --url https://api.fincra.com/checkout-core/charges/merchant-reference/order-001 \
      --header 'api-key: <YOUR_SECRET_KEY>'
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="By charge ID (poll)">
    Use this to actively poll a charge that is still pending or processing. Pass `?statusCheck=true` to trigger a live status check against the payment processor.

    **Endpoint:** `GET /checkout-core/charges/:id/verify`

    ```bash
    curl --request GET \
      --url 'https://api.fincra.com/checkout-core/charges/1093510/verify?statusCheck=true' \
      --header 'api-key: <YOUR_SECRET_KEY>'
    ```

    <Note>
      The charge `id` is the numeric ID returned in the payment response or webhook payload — not the reference string.
    </Note>
  </Tab>

## Payment statuses

| Status | Description | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `success` | Payment completed and confirmed. | Safe to deliver your product or service. |
| `pending` | Payment initiated but not yet completed. | Do not deliver. Continue polling or wait for the webhook. |
| `processing` | Payment is being processed by the payment provider. | Do not deliver. Continue polling. |
| `failed` | Payment failed, was declined, or expired. | Do not deliver. Notify the customer. |

## Which endpoint should I use?

| Situation | Recommended endpoint |
|---|---|
| Customer redirected back from HPP with reference in URL | By merchant reference |
| `onSuccess` callback fires in Drop-in Checkout | By Fincra reference |
| You need to check status of a pending Direct Charge | By charge ID with `?statusCheck=true` |
| Reconciling payments after the fact | By merchant reference |

## Best practices

- **Never rely solely on the redirect or `onSuccess` callback** to confirm payment. Always verify server-side.
- **Listen for webhooks** as your primary signal. The `charge.successful` event fires even if the customer closes their browser before being redirected back.
- **Poll with care.** If you're polling a pending charge, use exponential backoff to avoid hitting rate limits. See [Rate Limits](/developer-resources/rate-limits).
