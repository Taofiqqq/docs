Fincra provides a full transaction history for all payments collected through your account. You can access this from the dashboard or export it for reconciliation and accounting.

## Dashboard

View your collection history in the Fincra dashboard under **Payments → Transactions**. The dashboard shows:

- Transaction reference and merchant reference
- Payment method and currency
- Amount charged, fee, and amount settled
- Payment status
- Customer name and email
- Timestamp

You can filter by date range, payment method, currency, and status.

## Export collection history

To export your transaction history as a CSV file:

1. Go to **Payments → Transactions** in your dashboard.
2. Apply any filters you need (date range, currency, status).
3. Click **Export**.
4. The CSV file will be downloaded to your device.

The export includes all the fields shown in the dashboard view.

## Reconciliation tips

- Use your `merchantReference` (the reference you pass when creating a payment) to match Fincra transaction records with your own internal records.
- The `amountToSettle` field in the webhook payload is what lands in your wallet — use this for reconciliation, not the `amount` field.
- Filter exports by `status: success` to get only confirmed, settled payments.
- For virtual account payments, the `virtualAccount.accountNumber` field in the webhook identifies which customer's account received the payment.
