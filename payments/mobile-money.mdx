## How it works

**Via Checkout (Hosted Payment Page or Drop-in):**

1. Customer selects **Mobile Money** on the checkout page.
2. Customer enters their mobile number registered with their mobile money provider.
3. The customer receives a payment prompt on their phone and approves the transaction.
4. Fincra confirms the payment and marks it as successful.
5. Your wallet is credited and a `charge.successful` webhook fires.

**Via Direct Charge API:**

Include the customer's `phoneNumber` in the request payload. The customer receives a push prompt on their device to approve the charge. Poll the verify endpoint or listen for the webhook to confirm completion.

## Settlement

Mobile Money payments settle **instantly** into your Fincra wallet.

## Notes

- The customer's phone number must be registered with the mobile money operator for the prompt to be delivered.
- For XAF and XOF countries, mobile money is the only available payment method — there is no bank transfer or card option.
- For ZMW, both Mobile Money and Card are available — you can offer both or restrict to one using the `paymentMethods` parameter.
