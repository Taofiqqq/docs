Use this checklist to confirm your Payments integration is production-ready before switching to live credentials.

## Sandbox testing

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test all payment methods you plan to use">
    Run a full payment flow in sandbox for each method — Checkout, Payment Links, Direct Charge, or Virtual Accounts. Use Fincra's [test values](/sandbox/testing) to simulate successful and failed payments.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify payments server-side">
    Confirm you are calling the verify endpoint after every payment and checking the `status` field before delivering value.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle webhook events">
    Confirm your webhook endpoint receives and processes `charge.successful`. Test that your server responds with `200 OK` and handles the payload correctly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify webhook signatures">
    Confirm you are validating the webhook signature using your webhook secret. Never process unverified webhooks in production. See [Verify Webhooks](/webhooks/verify).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test failure scenarios">
    Simulate failed payments and confirm your application handles them gracefully — no value delivered, appropriate error shown to customer.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test reference uniqueness">
    Confirm every payment you create uses a unique `reference`. Duplicate references will be rejected.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Pre-launch checklist

<Steps>
  <Step title="Complete KYC and compliance review">
    Your Fincra account must be fully approved before accepting live payments. Check your account status in the dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request activation for restricted methods">
    If you plan to use **Direct Charge**, **card collections**, or **mobile money**, contact your account manager or email [compliance@fincra.com](mailto:compliance@fincra.com) to request activation. Allow time for compliance review.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Switch to production credentials">
    Replace sandbox API keys with your live API keys and update the base URL from `sandboxapi.fincra.com` to `api.fincra.com`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update your webhook URL">
    Ensure your production webhook URL is configured in the dashboard and points to your live server. See [Configure Webhooks](/webhooks/configure).
  </Step>
  <Step title="IP whitelisting (if applicable)">
    If you have IP whitelisting enabled, add your production server IP addresses. See [IP Whitelisting](/developer-resources/ip-whitelisting).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run a live smoke test">
    Make a real payment in production using your own card or bank account. Verify the webhook fires, the payment verifies correctly, and funds appear in your wallet.
  </Step>
</Steps>
