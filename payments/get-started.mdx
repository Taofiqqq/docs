## 1. Create your account and complete KYC

Sign up for a Fincra account and complete the KYC onboarding process. Once
your account is approved, you'll automatically receive an NGN wallet and
can start accepting payments immediately.

## 2. Understand what's available

Once approved, some payment options and methods are available immediately.
Others require additional activation.

### Available immediately

- **Virtual Accounts** — create NGN virtual accounts and start collecting payments
- **Payment Links** — create and share payment links with your customers
- **Checkout** — accept payments via Fincra's hosted payment page or drop-in checkout

### Requires activation

- **Direct Charge API**

To activate these, contact your account manager. Our compliance team will
review your KYC details and business use case before enabling access.

  account manager early if you know you'll need these methods.
