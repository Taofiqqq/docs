When a payment is successful, the funds settle into your Fincra wallet. Settlement is automatic — you don't need to trigger it manually.

## Settlement timelines

Settlement speed depends on the payment method used.

| Payment Method | Settlement | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Bank Transfer | Instant | Funds credited to your wallet as soon as the transfer is confirmed. |
| Mobile Money | Instant | Covers KES, GHS, UGX, ZMW, TZS, XAF, XOF. |
| PalmPay | Instant | NGN only. |
| PayAttitude (USSD) | Instant | NGN only. |
| Cards | T+1 | Funds settle the next business day. |
| EFT | T+1 | ZAR only. |

<Note>
  Settlement timelines are per business day. Payments processed on weekends or public holidays may take longer to settle.
</Note>

## Where funds settle

All payments settle into your Fincra wallet in the currency of the transaction. For example:
- An NGN payment settles into your NGN wallet.
- A KES mobile money payment settles into your KES wallet.

Once settled, you can use the funds to initiate [payouts](/payouts/overview), [currency conversions](/conversion/overview), or withdraw to your bank account.

## Fee deduction

Transaction fees are deducted from the settlement amount before funds reach your wallet. The `amountToSettle` field in the webhook payload shows exactly what you will receive after fees.

Who pays the fee depends on the `feeBearer` setting you configured when creating the payment:

| `feeBearer` | Effect |
|---|---|
| `business` | Fee is deducted from your settlement amount. Customer pays the stated amount. |
| `customer` | Fee is added to the customer's payment amount. You receive the full stated amount. |

## Viewing settlements

You can view your settlement history in the Fincra dashboard under **Payments → Settlements**. Each entry shows the payment reference, method, amount received, fee, amount settled, and settlement timestamp.

<Note>
  Settlement is dashboard-only. There is no API endpoint for fetching settlement records directly. Use the [Reporting](/payments/reporting) export for bulk data.
