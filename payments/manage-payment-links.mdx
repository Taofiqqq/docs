## Update a payment link

You can update a payment link's name, description, amount, currency, or other settings after creation.

**Endpoint:** `PATCH /checkout-core/payment-links/:id`

```bash
curl --request PATCH \
  --url https://api.fincra.com/checkout-core/payment-links/1213 \
  --header 'api-key: <YOUR_SECRET_KEY>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "amount": 500,
    "description": "Updated description"
  }'
```

Pass only the fields you want to update — all other fields remain unchanged.

## Disable a payment link

Disabling a payment link prevents new payments from being made on it. The link is not deleted — you can re-enable it later from your dashboard.

**Endpoint:** `PATCH /checkout-core/payment-links/:id`

```bash
curl --request PATCH \
  --url https://api.fincra.com/checkout-core/payment-links/1213 \
  --header 'api-key: <YOUR_SECRET_KEY>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "disabled": true
  }'
```

To re-enable, set `"disabled": false`.

## Delete a payment link

**Endpoint:** `DELETE /checkout-core/payment-links/:id`

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
  --url https://api.fincra.com/checkout-core/payment-links/1213 \
  --header 'api-key: <YOUR_SECRET_KEY>'
```

<Warning>
  Deleting a payment link is permanent. Customers who visit a deleted link will see an error. If you only want to temporarily stop accepting payments, disable the link instead.
</Warning>

## Track payments

Payments received through a payment link appear in your Fincra dashboard under **Payments → Payment Links → [Link Name]**.

You can also listen for the `charge.successful` webhook event to receive real-time notifications when a customer pays through your link. The webhook payload includes the payment link `reference` so you can identify which link triggered the payment.

For full webhook details, see [Webhooks](/webhooks/overview).
