A refund returns funds from a completed payment back to the customer. Fincra supports refunds for payments collected through Checkout, Payment Links, and Direct Charge.

<Info>
  Full refund details — process, supported currencies, timelines, and whether partial refunds are supported — are being confirmed with the Fincra disputes team. This page will be updated shortly.

## Initiate a refund

Refunds can be initiated from your Fincra dashboard.

1. Go to **Payments → Transactions** in your dashboard.
2. Find the transaction you want to refund.
3. Click on the transaction to open its details.
4. Click **Refund** and confirm.

<Note>
  API-based refund initiation — availability and endpoint to be confirmed.

## Refund timelines

Refund timelines depend on the original payment method and the customer's bank or mobile money provider. The customer will be notified once the refund is processed.

  Per-method refund timelines — coming soon.

## Refund status

You will receive a webhook notification when a refund is processed. The event and payload details will be documented here once confirmed.

## Overpayments

If a customer pays more than the expected amount (for example, via bank transfer), Fincra handles the discrepancy. Contact [support@fincra.com](mailto:support@fincra.com) for guidance on handling overpayment scenarios.
