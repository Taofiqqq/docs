EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer) is the standard bank payment method in South Africa. Customers pay directly from their South African bank account using online banking.

## Availability

| Currency | Country | Available via |
|---|---|---|
| ZAR | South Africa | Checkout (HPP, Drop-in), Direct Charge |

## How it works

**Via Checkout (Hosted Payment Page or Drop-in):**

1. Customer selects **EFT** on the checkout page.
2. Customer is redirected to their bank's online banking portal via Ozow (Fincra's EFT processing partner).
3. The customer logs in and approves the payment.
4. Fincra confirms the payment and marks it as successful.
5. Your wallet is credited and a `charge.successful` webhook fires.

**Via Direct Charge API:**

Use `"type": "eft"` in your charge request.

```json
{
  "type": "eft",
  "amount": 500,
  "currency": "ZAR",
  "customer": {
    "name": "Thabo Dlamini",
    "email": "thabo@example.com"
  }
}
```

## Settlement

EFT payments settle **T+1** (next business day) into your Fincra ZAR wallet.

## Notes

- For South Africa, both EFT and Card are available. You can offer both or restrict to one using the `paymentMethods` parameter when creating a checkout.
- EFT is the preferred payment method for many South African customers who prefer direct bank payments over card transactions.
