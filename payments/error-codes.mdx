When a Payments API request fails, Fincra returns an error response with a `success: false` flag and an error code in `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.

## Error response format

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "A human-readable description of the error.",
  "error": "ERROR_CODE"
}
```

## Common error codes

| Error Code | Description | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `VALIDATION_FAILED` | One or more required fields are missing or invalid. | Check the request payload against the field requirements. |
| `INVALID_CURRENCY` | The currency provided is not supported. | Check the [Supported Currencies](/payments/supported-currencies) page. |
| `DUPLICATE_REFERENCE` | A payment with this reference already exists. | Use a unique reference for every transaction. |
| `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS` | The customer does not have enough funds to complete the payment. | Ask the customer to use a different payment method or account. |
| `CARD_DECLINED` | The card was declined by the issuer. | Ask the customer to use a different card or contact their bank. |
| `EXPIRED_CARD` | The card used has expired. | Ask the customer to use a valid card. |
| `INVALID_CVV` | The CVV provided does not match the card. | Ask the customer to re-enter their card details. |
| `TRANSACTION_NOT_FOUND` | No transaction was found for the provided reference or ID. | Confirm the reference is correct. |
| `PAYMENT_METHOD_NOT_ENABLED` | The requested payment method is not enabled for your account. | Contact your account manager or email compliance@fincra.com. |
| `UNAUTHORIZED` | The API key provided is invalid or missing. | Check your API key in the dashboard. |
| `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | You have exceeded the API rate limit. | Implement exponential backoff and retry. See [Rate Limits](/developer-resources/rate-limits). |

## Handling errors in your integration

- Always check the `success` field before processing a response.
- Log the full error response including the `error` code for debugging.
- For `VALIDATION_FAILED`, inspect the `message` field — it typically describes which field caused the failure.
- For transient errors (network issues, rate limits), implement retry logic with exponential backoff.
- For permanent errors (declined cards, invalid references), surface an appropriate message to the customer and do not retry automatically.
