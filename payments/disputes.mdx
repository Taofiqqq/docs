A dispute is raised when a customer challenges a payment with their bank or card issuer. A chargeback is the formal reversal of a payment initiated by the customer's bank. Both require a timely response from you to protect your revenue.

  Full dispute and chargeback process details — notification flow, evidence requirements, submission steps, and resolution timelines — are being confirmed with the Fincra disputes team. This page will be updated shortly.

## How disputes work

When a dispute is raised against one of your transactions:

1. **You are notified** — Fincra will notify you when a dispute is received.
2. **You submit evidence** — Provide documentation that supports the validity of the transaction (proof of delivery, customer communication, etc.).
3. **Review** — The dispute is reviewed by Fincra and the relevant card network or bank.
4. **Resolution** — The dispute is resolved in favour of you or the customer.

## Chargebacks

A chargeback is a dispute that has escalated to a formal reversal by the customer's bank. Chargebacks are typically raised for card payments.

When a chargeback is received:

- The disputed funds are temporarily held pending resolution.
- You will be notified and asked to provide evidence.
- If the chargeback is resolved in your favour, the funds are released back to your wallet.
- If resolved in the customer's favour, the funds are returned to the customer.

## What evidence to prepare

Strong evidence typically includes:

- Proof that the product or service was delivered
- Customer communication (emails, chat logs)
- Transaction details (amount, date, reference, customer IP)
- Terms of service accepted by the customer
- Delivery confirmation (for physical goods)
