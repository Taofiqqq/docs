Fincra Payments lets you accept payments from your customers through multiple payment options and methods. Here's how it works end to end.

## The Payment Flow

{" "}

<Note>A flow diagram will go here showing the full payment journey.</Note>

#### 1. Create a payment

Your application initiates a payment using one of Fincra's payment options: Checkout, Payment Links, Direct Charge API, or Virtual Accounts. You pass the payment details (amount, currency, customer information) and Fincra returns a payment session.

#### 2. Customer pays

Your customer is presented with the available payment methods for their currency: cards, bank transfer, mobile money, or PayAttitude. They select their preferred method and complete the payment.

#### 3. Fincra processes the payment

Fincra handles the authorization, validation, and processing of the transaction. This includes fraud checks, payment method verification, and communication with the relevant payment processors.

#### 4. You get notified

Once the payment is processed, Fincra sends a webhook notification to your server with the payment status. You should always use webhooks to confirm payment status, never rely solely on the client-side redirect.

#### 5. Funds settle

After a successful payment, funds are settled into your Fincra wallet. Settlement timelines vary depending on the payment method and currency.

### Payment Lifecycle

Every payment moves through a series of states:

| Status       | Description                                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pending`    | Payment has been initiated but not yet completed by the customer.  |
| `successful` | Payment has been completed and confirmed.                          |
| `failed`     | Payment was not completed; either declined, expired, or cancelled. |

{" "}

<Tip>
  Always listen for webhook notifications to track payment state changes.

### Settlement

Settlement is when the funds from a completed payment are deposited into
your Fincra wallet.

Settlement timelines depend on the payment method:

| Payment Method     | Settlement Timeline |
| ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Cards              | [fill in]           |
| Bank Transfer      | [fill in]           |
| Mobile Money       | [fill in]           |
| PayAttitude (USSD) | [fill in]           |
| EFT                | [fill in]           |

Once settled, you can view your balance on the Fincra dashboard or via the Balance API, and use the funds for payouts, conversions, or withdrawals.

### Webhooks

Fincra uses webhooks to notify your application when a payment event occurs such as a successful payment, a failed transaction, or a completed settlement.
To receive webhooks, you need to:

1. Set up a webhook URL in your Fincra dashboard
2. Listen for incoming POST requests on that URL
3. Validate the webhook signature using your webhook secret key
4. Process the event and respond with a `200` status

For full details, see [Webhooks](/api-integration/webhooks).

## Fees

Every transaction processed through Fincra incurs a fee. You control who
bears the fee using the `feeBearer` parameter:

- `business` — your business absorbs the fee (default)
- `customer` — the fee is added to the customer's payment amount
