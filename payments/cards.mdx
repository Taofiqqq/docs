## Supported currencies

| Currency | Country/Region | Available via |
|---|---|---|
| NGN | Nigeria | Checkout, Direct Charge |

| ZAR | South Africa | Checkout, Direct Charge |
| USD | United States | Checkout, Direct Charge |

## How card payments work

**Via Checkout (Hosted Payment Page or Drop-in):**

The customer enters their card details on Fincra's secure payment form. Fincra handles the card data and authentication — your integration never touches raw card numbers.

**Via Direct Charge API:**

Card details are passed directly in your API request. Because card data flows through your system, your business must be **PCI-DSS compliant** before using this method.

## Authentication

Card payments may require additional authentication steps:

| Auth method | Description |
|---|---|
| OTP | A one-time password is sent to the customer's registered phone number. The customer enters it to confirm the payment. |
| 3D Secure (3DS) | The customer is redirected to their bank's authentication page. After completing verification, they are returned to your site. |

For Direct Charge integrations, handle authentication based on the `authorization.mode` field in the charge response. See [Accept a Payment](/payments/accept-a-payment) for details.

## Settlement

Card payments settle **T+1** (next business day) into your Fincra wallet.

## Requirements

| Integration | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Checkout (HPP or Drop-in) | None — Fincra handles card data |
| Direct Charge API | PCI-DSS compliance required + compliance approval |
