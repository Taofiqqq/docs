Payment Links let you collect payments without building a checkout integration. Create a link, share it with your customers, and they pay through Fincra's secure payment page.

**Best for:** Collecting one-time or recurring payments without writing code — invoices, donations, freelance work, event tickets, and more.

## How payment links work

When a customer opens a payment link, they land on a **pre-checkout page** that collects their name, email address, and payment amount. After filling in their details, they proceed to Fincra's checkout page to complete the payment.

<Note>
  This pre-checkout step is unique to Payment Links. When using [Checkout](/payments/hosted-payment-page) or [Direct Charge](/payments/direct-charge), customers go directly to the payment page — there is no pre-checkout step.
</Note>

The full customer flow:

```
Customer opens link
       ↓
Pre-checkout page (name, email, amount)
       ↓
Checkout page (selects payment method, pays)
       ↓
Payment confirmed
```

## Creating payment links

You can create payment links in two ways:

| | Dashboard | API |
|---|---|---|
| Who it's for | Non-technical users | Developers creating links at scale |
| Shareable URL | Available immediately | Available from dashboard after creation |
| Best for | One-off links | Automated link generation |

<Note>
  Payment links created via the API do not return a shareable URL in the API response. To get the link URL, go to your Fincra dashboard after creation.
