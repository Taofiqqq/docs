Fincra uses three credentials to authenticate your integration. Understanding when each is used — and how to keep them secure — is essential before you start building.

## Your credentials

| Credential | Header | Generated by | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| API Key | `api-key` | You, manually | All server-side API requests — required on every call |
| Public Key | `x-pub-key` | Fincra, automatically | Client-side requests — e.g. initializing the Hosted Payment Page checkout |
| Webhook Secret | — | Fincra, automatically | Verifying incoming webhook signatures |

## Generating your API key

<Info>
  The exact dashboard path to generate an API key will be confirmed and documented here.
</Info>

Your API key is not generated automatically — you must create it yourself from the dashboard. Once generated, copy and store it securely immediately. **You will not be able to view it again** after leaving the page.

<Warning>
  Your `api-key` is a secret credential. Never include it in client-side code, mobile apps, browser JavaScript, or public repositories. If exposed, rotate it immediately.
</Warning>

## Public key and webhook secret

Your `x-pub-key` and webhook secret are generated automatically by Fincra when your account is created. Find them in the API Keys section of your dashboard.

- **Public key** — safe to expose in client-side and browser-based code. Used specifically for initializing the Checkout experience on the client side.
- **Webhook secret** — used to verify that incoming webhook events genuinely came from Fincra. See [Verify Webhooks](/webhooks/verify).

## Rotating credentials

You can regenerate any credential at any time from the dashboard. Rotation takes effect immediately — the old credential stops working as soon as you regenerate.

**Rotate your API key if:**
- You suspect it has been exposed or compromised
- A team member with access to the key leaves your organization
- You detect unexpected or unauthorized API activity

<Note>
  Rotating your API key will break any active integration still using the old key. Update all your environments — staging, production — before or immediately after rotating.
</Note>

## Sandbox vs production credentials

Sandbox and production credentials are entirely separate. A key generated in sandbox will not work against the production API, and vice versa.

| Environment | Dashboard | API Base URL |
|---|---|---|
| Sandbox | [app.fincra.com](https://app.fincra.com) — Test Mode | `https://sandboxapi.fincra.com` |
| Production | [app.fincra.com](https://app.fincra.com) — Live Mode | `https://api.fincra.com` |

## Security best practices

- **Server-side only** — keep `api-key` exclusively on your backend. Use `x-pub-key` for anything client-facing.
- **Environment variables** — store credentials in environment variables, never hardcoded in source files.
- **No version control** — add credential files to `.gitignore`. Audit your repositories to ensure no keys have been accidentally committed.
- **Principle of least access** — limit which team members can view or regenerate API keys in the dashboard.
- **Rotate proactively** — establish a rotation schedule even if you haven't detected a compromise.
