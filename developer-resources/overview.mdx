## Authentication

Every request to the Fincra API requires an `api-key` header. Generate your key from the Fincra dashboard — see [Manage API Keys](/developer-resources/manage-api-keys).

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.fincra.com/...' \
  --header 'api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

Some endpoints additionally require `x-pub-key` or `x-business-id` — these are documented on each endpoint where applicable.

## Base URLs

| Environment | Base URL |
|---|---|
| Production | `https://api.fincra.com` |
| Sandbox | `https://sandboxapi.fincra.com` |

## Request format

All request bodies are JSON. Always include `Content-Type: application/json` on POST and PUT requests.

## Response format

All responses follow a consistent envelope:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "...",
  "data": { ... }
}
```

On errors, `success` is `false` and the error details are returned:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Human-readable message",
  "errorType": "MACHINE_READABLE_CODE"
}
```
