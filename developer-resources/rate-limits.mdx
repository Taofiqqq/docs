description: "Understand Fincra's API rate limits and how to handle limit errors."
---

Fincra applies rate limiting across all API endpoints to ensure stable performance for all users.

## Limits

| Scope | Limit |
|---|---|
| Global (all endpoints) | **50 requests per second** |

The limit applies globally across your account — not per endpoint. All API calls count toward the same bucket regardless of which endpoint you're calling.

## Rate limit errors

If you exceed the limit, Fincra returns an HTTP `429 Too Many Requests` response. Your integration should handle this gracefully:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Too many requests",
  "errorType": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED"
}
```

## Handling rate limit responses

When you receive a `429`:

1. **Stop sending requests immediately** — do not retry in a tight loop
2. **Implement exponential backoff** — wait before retrying, increasing the wait time on each successive failure
3. **Queue requests** — for high-volume operations like payroll runs, queue and dispatch at a controlled rate rather than sending all at once

```
Retry strategy:
  1st retry → wait 1s
  2nd retry → wait 2s
  3rd retry → wait 4s
  4th retry → wait 8s
  ...and so on
```

## Best practices

- **Batch where possible** — rather than making many small calls in quick succession, consolidate where the API allows
- **Use webhooks** — instead of polling status endpoints repeatedly, rely on webhook events to track payment and payout state changes
- **Cache static data** — responses from endpoints like [List Banks](/payouts/create-beneficiaries#list-supported-banks-and-mobile-money-providers) don't change frequently. Cache them locally rather than fetching on every request
