title: "Postman Collection"
description: "Explore and test every Fincra endpoint without writing a line of code."

Fincra's public Postman collection gives you pre-configured requests for every API endpoint — organized by product, with example payloads and environment variables ready to go. It's the fastest way to explore the API and test your integration.

<Info>
  The Fincra Postman collection is being finalized. The link to fork the collection will be added here once it's published.

## Getting started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fork the collection">
    Open the Fincra Postman collection and fork it into your own Postman workspace. This gives you a private copy you can run, modify, and save examples in.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set your environment variables">
    The collection uses environment variables so you can switch between sandbox and production without editing individual requests. Create a Postman environment and set:

    | Variable | Value |
    |---|---|
    | `base_url` | `https://sandboxapi.fincra.com` (sandbox) or `https://api.fincra.com` (production) |
    | `api_key` | Your Fincra API key |
    | `pub_key` | Your Fincra public key (`x-pub-key`) |
    | `businessID` | Your Fincra business ID |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make your first request">
    Start with something simple — fetch your wallets or list supported banks to confirm your credentials are working before moving on to payments or payouts.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How the collection is organized

The collection mirrors the structure of these docs — one folder per product:

| Folder | What's inside |
|---|---|
| **Payments** | Checkout, Payment Links, Direct Charge API, Virtual Accounts |
| **Payouts** | Initiate Transfer (bank + mobile money), Get by reference, Get by customer reference |
| **Wallet Transfers** | Payout to Fincra wallet |
| **Beneficiaries** | Create, Get, List, Update, Delete |
| **Wallets** | Create wallet, Fund wallet, Fetch wallets, Balance history, Statement |
| **Currency Conversion** | Rates, Generate Quote, Create Conversion, Verify, List |
| **Direct Debit** | Create Mandate, Fetch Mandate, List Mandates, Initiate Debit, Verify Debit |
| **Verification** | Account Number Verification, BVN Verification, Card BIN Lookup |
| **Core** | List Banks |

## Tips for using the collection

- **Use `{{$randomUUID}}` for `customerReference`** — Postman's built-in variable generates a fresh UUID on every request, preventing duplicate reference errors during testing.
- **Save multiple examples per request** — rather than duplicating requests for different scenarios, save named examples (e.g. "NGN Bank Payout", "TZS Mobile Money Payout") under the same request using Postman's Examples feature.
- **Use test values for simulation** — use the [sandbox test values](/sandbox/testing) to trigger specific success and failure outcomes without affecting real data.
- **Switch environments cleanly** — maintain separate Postman environments for sandbox and production. Never accidentally run a production test with live credentials.
