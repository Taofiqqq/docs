title: "IP Whitelisting"
description: "Restrict API access to trusted IP addresses."

IP whitelisting lets you limit Fincra API access to specific IP addresses — so only requests from your servers can authenticate successfully. This is an important layer of security for production integrations.

## How it works

Once you whitelist an IP address, Fincra rejects API requests that originate from any IP not on your list. This means even a valid `api-key` will be refused if the request comes from an unlisted address.

<Note>
  IP whitelisting applies to your live environment. We recommend configuring it before going live.

## Adding IP addresses

Manage your whitelisted IPs from the **Settings** section of the [Fincra dashboard](https://app.fincra.com):

1. Go to **Settings → IP Whitelisting**
2. Enter the IP address you want to whitelist
3. Save — the IP is immediately active

You can whitelist up to **3 IP addresses** directly from the dashboard.

## Adding more than 3 IPs

Once you've reached the 3-IP limit, the dashboard UI will indicate that you've hit the cap. To add more:

1. Go to the **IP Change Requests** tab in the IP Whitelisting section
2. Submit a request with the additional IP addresses you need
3. Fincra's team reviews and approves the request
4. Once approved, the new IPs are added to your whitelist

<Info>
  IP Change Requests are reviewed manually. Submit your request ahead of time if you know you'll need additional IPs before a planned deployment.

## Best practices

- **Whitelist server IPs only** — never whitelist a dynamic or shared IP (e.g. a developer's home connection or a VPN exit node)
- **Use static IPs for your API servers** — if your cloud infrastructure uses dynamic IPs, set up a NAT gateway with a fixed outbound IP and whitelist that
- **Rotate when compromised** — if you suspect an IP has been exposed or a server is compromised, submit an IP Change Request to remove it and add your new server's IP
- **Keep your list current** — remove IPs that are no longer in use after server migrations or infrastructure changes
