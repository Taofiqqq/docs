Fincra's mobile SDK lets you embed the payment experience directly inside your native app — without redirecting users to a browser or external page.

**Available at launch:** iOS

<Info>
  The iOS SDK is being finalized. Installation details and full reference documentation will be linked here once the SDK is published.

## iOS SDK

### Requirements

| | Minimum |
|---|---|
| iOS | 14.0+ |
| Xcode | 14.0+ |
| Swift | 5.7+ |

### Installation

**Swift Package Manager:**

```
https://github.com/fincra/fincra-ios-sdk
```

Add via Xcode: **File → Add Package Dependencies** → paste the URL above.

**CocoaPods:**

```ruby
pod 'FincraSDK'
```

### Initialization

Initialize the SDK at app startup using your `x-pub-key` — not your `api-key`:

```swift
import FincraSDK

@main
struct MyApp: App {
    init() {
        Fincra.initialize(publicKey: "YOUR_PUB_KEY")
    }
}
```

<Note>
  Always use your `x-pub-key` (public key) to initialize the mobile SDK. Your `api-key` is a server-side secret and must never be embedded in a mobile app.
</Note>

### Presenting the payment sheet

Create a payment session server-side, then pass the reference to the SDK to present the native payment UI:

```swift
Fincra.presentPayment(
    from: viewController,
    reference: "PAYMENT_REFERENCE_FROM_YOUR_SERVER",
    onSuccess: { reference in
        // Payment completed — always verify server-side via webhook
    },
    onFailure: { error in
        // Payment failed or customer cancelled
    }
)
```

<Warning>
  Always verify payment outcomes server-side via webhook. Never use the client-side `onSuccess` callback as the sole source of truth for payment confirmation.
</Warning>

### Integration approaches

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Pre-built UI" icon="mobile">
    Drop in Fincra's native payment sheet. Handles card input, bank selection, mobile money, and all supported methods automatically. Fastest path to production.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Custom UI" icon="paintbrush">
    Use the low-level SDK APIs to build a fully custom payment UI while Fincra handles transaction processing underneath.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

  Full SDK reference — methods, parameters, delegate protocols, error types, and customization options — will be linked here once the iOS SDK is published.
