Fincra's Direct Debit supports 23 Nigerian banks through the NIBSS Direct Debit infrastructure. Your customers must hold an account at one of these banks to authorize a mandate.

## Bank directory

<Note>
  **Design team:** Consider styling this as a visual grid with bank logos instead of a plain table — similar to payment method grids on Stripe/Adyen docs. Each card would show the bank logo, name, and code.

## Using bank codes

When creating a mandate, pass the bank code in the `customer.bankCode` field:

```json
{
  "customer": {
    "accountNumber": "0123456789",
    "bankCode": "044",
    "accountName": "JOHN DOE"
  }
}
```

<Warning>
  **Heritage Bank is not supported.** If a customer provides a Heritage Bank account, the mandate creation will fail. Direct the customer to use an account at one of the banks listed above.
</Warning>

## Tips

- **Validate before creating** — Use [Account Verification](/verification/verify-a-beneficiary-account) to confirm the customer's account number and name before creating a mandate. This prevents failed mandates due to incorrect details.
- **Store bank codes** — If your application has a bank selection UI, use the codes in the table above. These are NIBSS-assigned codes and are stable.
