## Step 2: Guide the customer through activation

<Note>
  **Design team:** Flow diagram needed here — visual showing the customer activation UX: Your app displays the NIBSS message → Customer opens banking app → Enters account number and ₦50 → Transfer completes → Mandate activated.
</Note>

The `responseDescription` field contains a NIBSS message with instructions for your customer. To activate the mandate:

1. **Display the message** — Show the `responseDescription` to your customer in your application. The message contains a specific bank account number and bank name.
2. **Customer pays ₦50** — The customer transfers exactly ₦50 to the account specified in the message, using their banking app, USSD, or bank branch.
3. **NIBSS authenticates** — The payment triggers NIBSS to verify and approve the mandate.
4. **Mandate moves to `approved`** — Once authenticated, the mandate status changes from `initiated` to `approved`.

<Warning>
  Display the `responseDescription` exactly as received. Each mandate gets a unique activation account — do not hardcode the account number or bank name.
</Warning>

### Activation tips

- **In-app display** — Parse the account number and bank name from the message and present them prominently in your UI, along with the ₦50 amount.
- **Notify the customer** — Send an SMS or email with the activation instructions in case the customer doesn't complete it immediately.
- **Poll for status** — After the customer reports completing the payment, check the mandate status using the [Manage Mandates](/direct-debit/manage-mandates) endpoint.

## Step 3: Verify the mandate is approved

After the customer completes the ₦50 payment, check that the mandate status has moved to `approved` before attempting to collect payments. See [Manage Mandates](/direct-debit/manage-mandates) for how to fetch mandate status.

Once the mandate is `approved`, you can start collecting payments. See [Collect a Payment](/direct-debit/collect-a-payment).
