Subscription businesses need reliable recurring billing that doesn't depend on card expiry dates or customer action. Card-based subscriptions fail when cards expire, are replaced, or hit spending limits. Direct debit pulls payments directly from the customer's bank account — the account number doesn't change, so billing continuity is built in.

## How it works

1. **Customer subscribes** — The customer signs up for your service and provides their bank details.
2. **Create a mandate** — Call the [Create Mandate API](/direct-debit/create-a-mandate) with the subscriber's bank details. Set the `amount` to the subscription fee and the date range to cover the subscription period.
3. **Subscriber activates** — The customer completes the ₦50 token payment to authorize the mandate.
4. **Bill on schedule** — Set up your system to call [Initiate Debit](/direct-debit/collect-a-payment) at each billing cycle (monthly, quarterly, etc.).
5. **Handle results** — Listen for webhooks to confirm payment or trigger dunning flows for failed debits.

## Example

```
Subscription details:
- Service: SaaS platform
- Monthly fee: ₦5,000
- Subscription period: 6 months (March – August 2026)

Mandate setup:
- amount: 5000
- startDate: "2026-03-01"
- endDate: "2026-08-31"
- description: "Monthly Subscription - PRO Plan"

Collection schedule:
- Initiate Debit on the 1st of each month
- 6 debits of ₦5,000 = ₦30,000 total collected
```

## Why this matters

- **No card expiry issues** — Bank accounts don't expire like cards. No involuntary churn from payment method failures.
- **Higher success rates** — Direct bank debits avoid card network declines, fraud blocks, and spending limits.
- **Predictable revenue** — Automated collection makes MRR forecasting more reliable.
- **Works for all customers** — Not all Nigerian customers have credit or debit cards suitable for recurring charges. Bank accounts are universal.
