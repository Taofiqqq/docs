Lending businesses need a reliable way to collect repayments from borrowers without depending on manual transfers. Missed payments lead to rising defaults, operational overhead from follow-up calls, and unpredictable cash flow. Direct debit solves this by letting you pull repayments directly from a borrower's bank account on your schedule.

## How it works

<Note>
  **Design team:** Flow diagram needed here — visual showing: Loan disbursed → Mandate created with repayment amount and loan term → Borrower activates with ₦50 → Lender's system triggers monthly debits → Funds settle to wallet → Loan closes when term ends.
</Note>

1. **Disburse the loan** — Issue the loan to the borrower through your existing process.
2. **Create a mandate** — Call the [Create Mandate API](/direct-debit/create-a-mandate) with the borrower's bank details. Set the `amount` to the monthly repayment amount, `startDate` to the first repayment date, and `endDate` to the final repayment date.
3. **Borrower activates** — The borrower makes the one-time ₦50 token payment to authorize the mandate.
4. **Schedule collections** — Set up a cron job or scheduler in your system to call [Initiate Debit](/direct-debit/collect-a-payment) on each repayment date.
5. **Handle results** — Listen for `direct_debit.success` and `direct_debit.failed` webhooks to update your loan management system.
6. **Mandate expires** — When the `endDate` passes (end of loan term), the mandate naturally stops accepting debits.

## Example

```
Loan details:
- Principal: ₦500,000
- Monthly repayment: ₦50,000
- Term: 12 months (March 2026 – February 2027)

Mandate setup:
- amount: 50000
- startDate: "2026-03-01"
- endDate: "2027-02-28"
- description: "Loan Repayment - LN-2026-0042"

Collection schedule:
- Your system triggers Initiate Debit on the 1st of each month
- 12 debits of ₦50,000 = ₦600,000 total collected
```

## Why this matters

- **Reduce defaults** — Automated collection removes the friction of manual repayment. Borrowers don't need to remember or initiate transfers.
- **Predictable cash flow** — Collections happen on your schedule, making revenue forecasting more reliable.
- **Lower operational cost** — No manual follow-up calls or SMS reminders for routine repayments.
- **Instant settlement** — Collected funds settle to your wallet immediately (default), ready for re-lending or operations.
