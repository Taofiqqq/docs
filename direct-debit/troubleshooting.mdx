This page covers common issues you may encounter when working with Direct Debit and how to resolve them.

## Mandate issues

### Mandate stuck on `initiated`

**Symptom:** The mandate was created but the status hasn't moved to `approved`.

**Possible causes:**
- The customer hasn't completed the ₦50 token payment yet.
- The customer sent the wrong amount (not exactly ₦50).
- The customer sent the payment to the wrong account.

**Resolution:**
- Confirm with your customer that they've completed the ₦50 payment to the exact account and bank specified in the `responseDescription`.
- Re-display the activation instructions to the customer — the account number and bank name are in the `responseDescription` from the Create Mandate response.
- If the customer confirms they've paid and the status hasn't changed, contact Fincra support.

### Mandate `declined`

**Symptom:** The mandate status is `declined` after the customer attempted activation.

**Possible causes:**
- The customer's bank declined the mandate authorization.
- The bank account details provided were incorrect.
- The customer's bank is not supported (e.g., Heritage Bank).

**Resolution:**
- Verify the customer's bank is in the [Supported Banks](/direct-debit/supported-banks) list.
- Use [Account Verification](/verification/verify-a-beneficiary-account) to confirm the account number and name are correct.
- Create a new mandate with corrected details if needed.

### Can't cancel or suspend a mandate

**Symptom:** You want to stop collecting from a customer but there's no cancel API.

**Explanation:** Fincra's Direct Debit does not support cancelling, suspending, or revoking mandates via API. Once approved, a mandate stays approved until its `endDate` passes.

**Workaround:** Stop initiating debits against the mandate. The mandate will naturally expire when the `endDate` passes and all debit attempts after that date will fail.

## Debit issues

### Debit failed — insufficient funds

**Symptom:** `direct_debit.failed` webhook received. Customer's account doesn't have enough funds.

**Resolution:**
- Notify the customer to fund their account.
- Retry the debit after a reasonable delay (e.g., 24–48 hours).
- Implement exponential backoff if you're retrying automatically.

### Debit failed — mandate date range

**Symptom:** Debit attempt fails because the current date is outside the mandate's `startDate`–`endDate` range.

**Resolution:**
- Check the mandate's date range using [Manage Mandates](/direct-debit/manage-mandates).
- If the mandate has expired, create a new mandate with an updated date range.
- Ensure your system checks the date range before attempting debits to avoid unnecessary failures.

### Debit failed — unknown reason

**Symptom:** `direct_debit.failed` webhook received but the reason isn't clear.

**Resolution:**
- Check the webhook payload for any error details.
- Verify the mandate status is `approved` and within its date range.
- Retry once after a short delay.
- If the issue persists, contact Fincra support with the mandate reference and debit reference.

## Webhook issues

### Not receiving webhooks

**Symptom:** Debits are processing but your webhook endpoint isn't receiving events.

**Resolution:**
- Verify your webhook URL is correctly configured in the [Fincra dashboard](https://dashboard.fincra.com). See [Configure Webhooks](/webhooks/configure).
- Ensure your endpoint is publicly accessible and returns a `200` status code.
- Check your server logs for incoming requests that may be failing validation.
- Verify the webhook signature to ensure you're not accidentally rejecting valid payloads. See [Verify Webhooks](/webhooks/verify).

### Duplicate webhook events

**Symptom:** Receiving the same webhook event multiple times.

**Resolution:**
- Implement idempotency in your webhook handler using the event reference or debit reference as a key.
- Always return a `200` response promptly — slow responses may cause Fincra to retry delivery.

## Integration issues

### No sandbox environment

Direct Debit does not have a sandbox. All testing happens in production.

**How to test safely:**
- Use your own bank account as the customer account.
- Use a small mandate amount (e.g., ₦100).
- Complete the full flow: create mandate → ₦50 activation → initiate debit → verify webhook.
- See [Integration Checklist](/direct-debit/integration-checklist) for the full testing guide.
