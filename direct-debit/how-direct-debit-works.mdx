This page explains how Fincra's Direct Debit product works end-to-end — from creating a mandate to collecting payments and receiving funds. Read this before you start building.

## Mandates

A mandate is an authorization from your customer that allows you to pull funds from their bank account. Every direct debit collection requires an active mandate.

Mandates are:
- **Created by you** (the merchant) via the API, with the customer's bank account details
- **Authorized by the customer** through a one-time ₦50 token payment
- **Scoped to a date range** — defined by `startDate` and `endDate`
- **Fixed amount** — the `amount` field sets the debit amount for each collection

There is no frequency or scheduling built into the mandate. You decide when and how often to collect — the mandate simply authorizes you to do so within the date range.

## Mandate lifecycle

<Note>
  **Design team:** State diagram needed here — visual showing: `initiated` → (customer pays ₦50) → `approved`, and `initiated` → (customer declines or auth fails) → `declined`. Keep it simple — only 3 states.
</Note>

Direct debit mandates have three statuses:

| Status | Description |
|---|---|
| `initiated` | Mandate has been created. Waiting for the customer to authorize with the ₦50 token payment. |
| `approved` | Customer has authorized the mandate. You can now collect payments against it. |
| `declined` | Authorization failed or was declined by the customer's bank. |

### Key things to know about mandate status

- **No cancel or suspend** — Once a mandate is approved, it stays approved. There is no API to cancel, suspend, or revoke a mandate.
- **No expiry transition** — Mandates don't transition to an "expired" status. When the `endDate` passes, the mandate remains `approved` but any debit attempts will fail date validation.
- **Transitions are one-way** — A mandate moves from `initiated` to either `approved` or `declined`. There are no other transitions.

## The ₦50 activation flow

<Note>
  **Design team:** Flow diagram needed here — visual showing the customer-facing activation experience: API response contains bank details → Customer opens banking app → Transfers ₦50 to the specified account → NIBSS authenticates → Mandate moves to `approved`.
</Note>

When you create a mandate, the API response includes a `responseDescription` field containing instructions from NIBSS. This message tells the customer exactly what to do:

1. **You create the mandate** — Call `POST /v2/mandate-mgt/mandates/` with the customer's details.
2. **API returns activation instructions** — The `responseDescription` contains a NIBSS message with a specific bank account number and bank name.
3. **Customer makes the ₦50 payment** — The customer transfers exactly ₦50 to the account specified in the message using their banking app or USSD.
4. **NIBSS authenticates** — The ₦50 payment triggers NIBSS to authenticate the mandate.
5. **Mandate is approved** — The mandate status moves from `initiated` to `approved`.

<Warning>
  The `responseDescription` is a NIBSS-generated message. Display it to your customer exactly as received — it contains the specific account number and bank they need to pay. Each mandate gets a unique activation account.
</Warning>

### Example `responseDescription`

The message follows this pattern:

> "Welcome to NIBSS e-mandate authentication service, a seamless and convenient authentication experience. Kindly proceed with a token payment of N50:00 into account number "XXXXXXXXXX" with [Bank Name]. This payment will trigger the authentication of your mandate. Thank You"

## Collecting payments

Once a mandate is `approved`, you can initiate debits against it using the [Collect a Payment](/direct-debit/collect-a-payment) endpoint. Each debit:

- Pulls the mandate's `amount` from the customer's bank account
- Must fall within the mandate's `startDate` and `endDate`
- Settles to your Fincra NGN wallet

You control the timing — there's no automatic scheduling. Call the endpoint whenever you need to collect.

## Settlement

Successful debits settle to your Fincra NGN wallet. The default settlement behavior is **instant to wallet** — funds are available as soon as the debit succeeds.

Your account may have custom settlement settings configured by your account manager:

| Setting | Options |
|---|---|
| **Settlement time** | Instant, next day, end of week |
| **Settlement interval** | Daily, weekly, monthly |
| **Settlement destination** | Wallet (default) |

If you're unsure about your settlement configuration, contact your account manager.

## Webhooks

Fincra sends webhook events for direct debit transactions:

| Event | Description |
|---|---|
| `direct_debit.success` | A debit was successfully collected from the customer's account. |
| `direct_debit.failed` | A debit attempt failed (insufficient funds, account issues, mandate expired, etc.). |

Listen for these events to update your system in real time rather than polling the API. For setup and validation, see [Webhooks](/webhooks/overview).

## Key things to know

- **Nigeria only** — Direct Debit is powered by NIBSS and only supports Nigerian bank accounts in NGN.
- **API only** — Mandates and debits are managed entirely through the API. There is no dashboard interface.
- **No sandbox** — Direct Debit does not have a sandbox environment. Testing happens in production. See [Integration Checklist](/direct-debit/integration-checklist) for production testing guidance.
- **23 banks supported** — Heritage Bank is excluded. See [Supported Banks](/direct-debit/supported-banks).
- **No amount limits** — There are no minimum or maximum debit amounts enforced by Fincra. Limits may apply at the customer's bank level.
- **Fees** — Direct debit fees are agreed between your business and Fincra's sales team. Contact your account manager for pricing details.
