---

Fincra's Direct Debit lets you pull funds directly from your customers' bank accounts in Nigeria using NIBSS-powered mandates. Once a customer authorizes a mandate, you can collect payments against it without requiring the customer to take action each time — ideal for loan repayments, insurance premiums, subscriptions, and savings collections.

## Key benefits

- **Merchant-initiated collection** — Once a mandate is approved, you initiate debits on your schedule. No need to wait for customers to make payments.
- **NIBSS-powered** — Built on NIBSS Direct Debit infrastructure, the standard for automated bank-to-bank collections in Nigeria.
- **Fast activation** — Customers authorize mandates by making a one-time ₦50 token payment. Activation takes minutes, not days.
- **23 supported banks** — Covers all major Nigerian banks. See [Supported Banks](/direct-debit/supported-banks) for the full list.

## How it works

<Note>
  **Design team:** Flow diagram needed here — visual showing the end-to-end direct debit flow: Merchant creates mandate → Customer authorizes with ₦50 → Mandate approved → Merchant initiates debit → Funds settle to wallet.
</Note>

1. **Create a mandate** — Submit the customer's bank account details and the mandate parameters (amount, date range) to the [Create Mandate API](/direct-debit/create-a-mandate).
2. **Customer authorizes** — The customer makes a one-time ₦50 token payment to a bank account provided in the API response. This activates the mandate.
3. **Collect payments** — Once the mandate is approved, [initiate debits](/direct-debit/collect-a-payment) against it whenever you need to collect.
4. **Funds settle** — Successful debits settle to your Fincra NGN wallet.
