## Understanding mandate statuses

| Status | Meaning | Can you collect? |
|---|---|---|
| `initiated` | Mandate created, waiting for customer to complete the ₦50 activation payment. | No |
| `approved` | Customer has authorized the mandate. Ready for collections. | Yes |
| `declined` | Authorization failed or was declined by the customer's bank. | No |

### After `endDate` passes

When a mandate's `endDate` passes, the status remains `approved` — it does not change to "expired." However, any debit attempts after the `endDate` will fail date validation. If you need to continue collecting from the same customer, create a new mandate with an updated date range.

### No cancel or suspend

There is no API to cancel, suspend, or revoke an active mandate. Once approved, a mandate stays approved until its `endDate` passes. To stop collecting from a customer, simply stop initiating debits against their mandate.

## Common patterns

### Polling for activation

After creating a mandate and directing the customer to complete the ₦50 payment, poll the fetch endpoint to detect when the status changes to `approved`:

1. Create the mandate and display the activation instructions to the customer.
2. Poll `GET /v2/mandate-mgt/mandates/{reference}` at reasonable intervals (e.g., every 30 seconds).
3. When `status` changes to `approved`, notify the customer and begin collections.

### Checking mandates before collecting

Before initiating a debit, verify that:
- The mandate status is `approved`
- The current date falls within the mandate's `startDate` and `endDate`

This avoids failed debit attempts and unnecessary error handling.
