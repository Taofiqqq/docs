---

Once a mandate is `approved`, use the Initiate Debit endpoint to pull funds from the customer's bank account.

## Prerequisites

- **Approved mandate** — The mandate status must be `approved`. See [Manage Mandates](/direct-debit/manage-mandates) to check status.
- **Within date range** — The current date must fall between the mandate's `startDate` and `endDate`.
- **Webhook configured** — Set up a webhook to receive `direct_debit.success` and `direct_debit.failed` events. See [Configure Webhooks](/webhooks/configure).

## Initiate a debit

<Note>
  **Design team:** Flow diagram needed here — visual showing: Merchant calls Initiate Debit → Fincra sends to NIBSS → NIBSS debits customer's bank → Funds settle to merchant's Fincra wallet → Webhook fires.
</Note>

### Request

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.fincra.com/mandate-mgt/mandates/payment' \
--header 'api-key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "mandateReference": "mr_923c73c9-8f3a-478c-934a-2e472568891b"
}'
```

### Request body

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mandateReference` | string | Yes | The reference of the approved mandate to debit against. |

The debit amount is determined by the mandate's `amount` field — you do not specify an amount per debit.

## Verify debit status

After initiating a debit, you can check its status using the debit reference.

### Request

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.fincra.com/mandate-mgt/mandates/payment/YOUR_DEBIT_REFERENCE' \
--header 'api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

## Webhooks

Fincra sends webhook events for every debit attempt:

| Event | Description |
|---|---|
| `direct_debit.success` | The debit was successful. Funds have been collected and will settle to your wallet. |
| `direct_debit.failed` | The debit failed. Common reasons include insufficient funds, account restrictions, or the mandate's `endDate` having passed. |

<Warning>
  Always listen for webhooks as the primary way to confirm debit outcomes. The Verify endpoint is a backup for reconciliation — webhooks give you real-time results.
</Warning>

For webhook setup and signature validation, see [Webhooks](/webhooks/overview).

## Collection patterns

### One-time collection

For a single collection (e.g., a one-off loan repayment), create a mandate and initiate a single debit after activation. The mandate remains available for future debits if needed.

### Recurring collection

For recurring collections (e.g., monthly insurance premiums), set up a cron job or scheduler in your system that calls the Initiate Debit endpoint on your desired schedule. Fincra does not schedule debits for you — your system controls the timing.

```
Example: Monthly loan repayment
- Mandate: ₦10,000, startDate: 2026-03-01, endDate: 2026-12-31
- Your system: Cron job on the 1st of each month → calls Initiate Debit
- Result: 10 monthly debits of ₦10,000 each
```

### Handling failed debits

When a debit fails:

1. **Check the webhook payload** — The `direct_debit.failed` event includes details on why the debit failed.
2. **Retry if appropriate** — For transient failures (e.g., insufficient funds), you may retry after a delay. Implement exponential backoff.
3. **Notify the customer** — If the failure is due to insufficient funds, notify the customer to fund their account.
4. **Check the mandate** — If debits consistently fail, verify the mandate is still within its date range.

## Settlement

Successful debits settle to your Fincra NGN wallet. The default is **instant settlement** — funds are available immediately. Your business may have custom settlement settings. See [How Direct Debit Works](/direct-debit/how-direct-debit-works#settlement) for details.
