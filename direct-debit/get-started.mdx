This guide walks you through what you need before creating your first direct debit mandate.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use Direct Debit, ensure you have:

- **Fincra account** — [Create an account](https://dashboard.fincra.com) if you don't have one.
- **KYC verification** — Complete your business verification. See [Complete Verification](/get-started/complete-verification).
- **API key** — Generate your production API key from the dashboard. See [Manage API Keys](/developer-resources/manage-api-keys).
- **Webhook URL** — Configure a webhook endpoint to receive `direct_debit.success` and `direct_debit.failed` events. See [Configure Webhooks](/webhooks/configure).

<Warning>
  Direct Debit does not have a sandbox environment. All testing and integration happens in production. See the [Integration Checklist](/direct-debit/integration-checklist) for production testing guidance.
</Warning>

## Step 1: Confirm activation

Direct Debit may require activation by your Fincra account manager. Contact your account manager or the sales team to confirm that Direct Debit is enabled for your business.

## Step 2: Collect customer details

To create a mandate, you'll need the following from your customer:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Account number | The customer's Nigerian bank account number (NUBAN) |
| Bank code | The NIBSS bank code for the customer's bank. See [Supported Banks](/direct-debit/supported-banks). |
| Account name | The full name on the customer's bank account |
| Phone number | Customer's phone number |
| Email | Customer's email address |
| Address | Customer's address |

<Tip>
  Use [Account Verification](/verification/verify-a-beneficiary-account) to validate the customer's account number and name before creating a mandate. This avoids failed mandates from incorrect details.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Define mandate parameters

Decide the terms of the mandate:

| Parameter | What to decide |
|---|---|
| **Amount** | How much to debit per collection (in NGN) |
| **Start date** | When the mandate becomes effective |
| **End date** | When the mandate expires — debits after this date will fail |
| **Description** | A human-readable label for the mandate (e.g., "Monthly loan repayment") |

## Step 4: Build your integration

With your prerequisites in place, you're ready to integrate:

1. **Create a mandate** — Call the Create Mandate API with the customer's details and mandate parameters. See [Create a Mandate](/direct-debit/create-a-mandate).
2. **Handle activation** — Display the `responseDescription` from the API response to your customer so they can complete the ₦50 token payment.
3. **Monitor mandate status** — Poll the [Manage Mandates](/direct-debit/manage-mandates) endpoint or wait for the status to change to `approved`.
4. **Collect payments** — Once approved, initiate debits using the [Collect a Payment](/direct-debit/collect-a-payment) endpoint.
5. **Handle webhooks** — Process `direct_debit.success` and `direct_debit.failed` events to update your system.

## Step 5: Test in production

Since there's no sandbox, test your full integration in production with a small amount:

- [ ] Create a mandate with a real bank account (use your own for testing)
- [ ] Complete the ₦50 activation flow
- [ ] Initiate a small debit and confirm it succeeds
- [ ] Verify webhook delivery

See the full [Integration Checklist](/direct-debit/integration-checklist) for a complete testing guide.
