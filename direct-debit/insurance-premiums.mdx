Insurance companies need consistent premium collection to keep policies active. When customers miss payments, policies lapse — leading to coverage gaps for the customer and lost revenue for the insurer. Direct debit automates premium collection so payments happen on time without customer intervention.

## How it works

<Note>
  **Design team:** Flow diagram needed here — visual showing: Policy issued → Mandate created for premium amount and policy term → Policyholder activates with ₦50 → Insurer's system triggers periodic debits → Funds settle → Policy stays active.
</Note>

1. **Issue the policy** — Onboard the customer and issue their insurance policy.
2. **Create a mandate** — Call the [Create Mandate API](/direct-debit/create-a-mandate) with the policyholder's bank details. Set the `amount` to the premium amount, and the date range to match the policy term.
3. **Policyholder activates** — The customer completes the ₦50 token payment to authorize the mandate.
4. **Schedule collections** — Set up your system to call [Initiate Debit](/direct-debit/collect-a-payment) on each premium due date (monthly, quarterly, or as agreed).
5. **Handle results** — Listen for webhooks to confirm payment or flag failures for follow-up.
6. **Renew or close** — When the policy term (and mandate `endDate`) expires, create a new mandate if the customer renews.

## Example

```
Policy details:
- Type: Health insurance
- Monthly premium: ₦15,000
- Policy term: 1 year (April 2026 – March 2027)

Mandate setup:
- amount: 15000
- startDate: "2026-04-01"
- endDate: "2027-03-31"
- description: "Health Insurance Premium - POL-HI-8821"

Collection schedule:
- Initiate Debit on the 1st of each month
- 12 debits of ₦15,000 = ₦180,000 total collected
```

## Why this matters

- **Prevent policy lapses** — Automated collection ensures premiums are paid on time, keeping policies active.
- **Improve retention** — Customers are less likely to churn when payments are automated — no missed deadlines, no manual transfers.
- **Reduce admin overhead** — No chasing policyholders for overdue premiums.
- **Scale operations** — Collect from thousands of policyholders with the same API call, regardless of portfolio size.
