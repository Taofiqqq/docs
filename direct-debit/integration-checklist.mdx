description: "A step-by-step checklist for testing and validating your direct debit integration in production."

Direct Debit does not have a sandbox environment. Use this checklist to test and validate your integration in production before going live with real customers.

<Warning>
  All testing happens in production with real bank accounts and real transactions. Use your own bank account and small amounts during testing.
</Warning>

## Before you start

### Account setup

- [ ] Your Fincra account is verified (KYC complete). See [Complete Verification](/get-started/complete-verification).
- [ ] Direct Debit is activated for your business (confirm with your account manager).
- [ ] You have your production API key. See [Manage API Keys](/developer-resources/manage-api-keys).
- [ ] You have your Fincra business ID from the dashboard.

### Webhook setup

- [ ] Configure your webhook URL in the [production dashboard](https://dashboard.fincra.com). See [Configure Webhooks](/webhooks/configure).
- [ ] Your webhook endpoint is publicly accessible and returns a `200` status code.
- [ ] Your webhook handler validates the signature. See [Verify Webhooks](/webhooks/verify).

## Test the full flow

### Mandate creation

- [ ] Call `POST /v2/mandate-mgt/mandates/` with your own bank account details and a small amount (e.g., ₦100).
- [ ] Confirm the response includes `status: "initiated"` and a `reference` starting with `mr_`.
- [ ] Confirm the `responseDescription` contains a NIBSS activation message with a bank account number and bank name.
- [ ] Save the mandate `reference` for subsequent steps.

### Mandate activation

- [ ] Transfer exactly ₦50 to the account specified in the `responseDescription`.
- [ ] Poll `GET /v2/mandate-mgt/mandates/{reference}` until the status changes to `approved`.
- [ ] Confirm the mandate status is `approved`.

### List and fetch mandates

- [ ] Call `GET /v2/mandate-mgt/mandates` and confirm your test mandate appears in the list.
- [ ] Call `GET /v2/mandate-mgt/mandates/{reference}` and confirm the mandate details are correct.

### Collect a payment

- [ ] Call `POST /mandate-mgt/mandates/payment` with the mandate reference.
- [ ] Confirm you receive a `direct_debit.success` webhook event.
- [ ] Verify the debit status using the verify endpoint.
- [ ] Confirm funds have settled to your Fincra NGN wallet.

### Error handling

- [ ] Attempt a debit on a mandate that is still `initiated` (not yet activated) — confirm it fails gracefully.
- [ ] Test your webhook handler for both `direct_debit.success` and `direct_debit.failed` events.
- [ ] Confirm your system handles duplicate webhook deliveries idempotently.

## Go live

Once you've validated the full flow with your own account:

- [ ] Update your integration to use customer-provided bank details instead of your test account.
- [ ] Confirm your system displays the `responseDescription` to customers for mandate activation.
- [ ] Confirm your system has a scheduler or trigger mechanism for initiating debits on your desired schedule.
- [ ] Confirm your webhook handler updates your application state correctly on success and failure.
- [ ] Monitor the first few live mandates and collections closely to confirm everything works as expected.

## Production testing tips

- **Use your own account** — Test with your personal bank account at one of the [supported banks](/direct-debit/supported-banks).
- **Keep amounts small** — Use ₦100 or ₦200 for test mandates to minimize exposure.
- **Test the full cycle** — Don't skip the ₦50 activation or the debit step. The integration isn't validated until funds actually move.
- **Test failure scenarios** — Understand how your system handles failed debits by testing with accounts that may have restrictions or low balances.
