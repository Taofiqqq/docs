## Sign up

Go to [app.fincra.com](https://app.fincra.com) and create your account. You'll be asked for a few details about your business:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Business type | The type of business you operate |
| Monthly volume | Your expected monthly transaction volume |
| Incorporation number | Your company's registration number |
| How did you hear about Fincra | |

Once submitted, verify your email address. You can then log in and access the sandbox environment immediately — no waiting for compliance approval.

## What you get on first login

When you log in for the first time, Fincra gives you a guided tour of the dashboard. You can take it or skip it.

You'll land in **sandbox (Test Mode)** — a fully simulated environment where you can integrate and test without touching real money.

### Your sandbox wallets

What wallets you start with depends on the country you registered with:

| Registration country | Sandbox wallets on login |
|---|---|
| Nigeria | NGN wallet only — create additional currency wallets via API |
| Any other country | All supported currency wallets created automatically |

<Note>
  You can fund any sandbox wallet instantly from the **Balance** tab in the dashboard using **Fund Balance**, or via the Fund Wallet API. Use this to test any Fincra product without needing real funds.
</Note>

## Next step: complete verification

To go live, you'll need to submit your compliance documents for review. You can do this while you integrate and test in sandbox — the two happen in parallel.
