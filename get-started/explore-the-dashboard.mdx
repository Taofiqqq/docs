Everything you need to manage your Fincra account lives in the dashboard at [app.fincra.com](https://app.fincra.com) — from API keys and webhooks to balance management, transaction history, and compliance settings.

## Sandbox and live mode

The dashboard runs both your sandbox and live environments in one place. The **Test Mode** toggle at the top of the page controls which environment you're working in.

| Mode | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Test Mode** (sandbox) | Simulated environment — test your integration freely with no real money |
| **Live Mode** | Real transactions — all payments, payouts, and conversions are live |

<Warning>
  The Test Mode toggle only becomes available after your compliance verification is approved. You cannot switch to Live Mode until your account is verified.
</Warning>

Fincra's sandbox fully simulates the production environment — webhooks fire, payment statuses transition, and the complete transaction lifecycle runs end to end. There is no behavioral difference between sandbox and live, only the data and money are real in live mode.

## Key areas of the dashboard

| Section | What you'll find |
|---|---|
| **Balance** | View wallet balances, fund sandbox wallets, manage top-ups, export balance history |
| **Transactions** | Full history of payments received and payouts sent |
| **Payouts** | Initiate and track outgoing transfers |
| **API Keys** | Generate and manage your API key, public key, and webhook secret |
| **Webhooks** | Configure webhook endpoints and view delivery logs |
| **Settings** | Business profile, team members, IP whitelisting |
| **Compliance** | Onboarding forms and document uploads |

## API keys

Fincra uses three credentials — each serves a different purpose:

| Credential | Generated | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `api-key` | Manually, by you | All server-side API requests — required on every call |
| `x-pub-key` | Auto-generated by Fincra | Client-side requests (e.g. initializing Checkout) |
| Webhook secret | Auto-generated by Fincra | Verifying webhook signatures |

Generate your API key from the **API Keys** section of the dashboard. Your public key and webhook secret are generated automatically — you can regenerate (rotate) any of them at any time. Rotate immediately if you suspect a key has been compromised.

<Note>
  Keep your `api-key` server-side only. Never expose it in client-side code, mobile apps, or public repositories.
</Note>

## Funding your sandbox wallet

You can add test funds to any sandbox wallet directly from the dashboard:

1. Go to the **Balance** tab
2. Click **Fund Balance**
3. Select the currency and enter the amount

You can also fund via API — see the [Wallets](/wallets/overview) section.
