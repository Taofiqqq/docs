Fincra's compliance team reviews your business before you can go live. You can submit your verification documents at any time after signing up — and keep building in sandbox while the review is in progress.

## What you need to submit

Verification is done through the onboarding forms in your dashboard. There are four sections:

### Business information

| Field | |
|---|---|
| Business name | |
| Company type | |
| Business model | |
| Incorporation number | |
| Date of incorporation | |
| Country of incorporation | |
| Tax number | |
| Company address, city, state, zip code | |
| Description of what your business does | |
| Company website | |

### Document uploads

| Document | Required |
|---|---|
| Business Registration / Incorporation Certificate | Yes |
| Article of Association | Yes |
| Operating Business Utility Bill | Yes |
| Additional documents | Optional |

### Directors

You must add at least one director. For each director, you'll provide:

- First and last name
- Position
- Date of birth
- Nationality
- Identification document type and number
- Country of issue
- Residential address
- Proof of identification (document upload)
- Proof of residential address (document upload)

### Shareholders

You must add at least one shareholder. Fincra supports two shareholder types:

- **Natural Persons / UBOs** — individual beneficial owners
- **Legal Entity** — a company that holds shares

### PEP declaration (optional)

If any director or shareholder is a Politically Exposed Person, declare their name, position, and PEP status. This is optional if not applicable.

## After submitting

Once you submit, Fincra's compliance team will review your documents. They'll approve your account or reach out if they need anything additional.

<Note>
  Compliance review timelines vary. Continue integrating in sandbox while you wait — your sandbox access is not affected by the review status.

## Going live

Once your account is approved, the **Test Mode** toggle at the top of your dashboard becomes active. Click it to switch to the live environment.

You'll know you're live when the toggle shows **Live Mode** and the dashboard header changes.
