title: "Go Live Checklist"
description: "Everything you need to do before switching your Fincra integration to production."
---

Before you go live, run through this checklist to confirm your account, credentials, and integration are production-ready. For product-specific validation steps, see the integration checklist in each product section.

---

## 1. Complete compliance verification

Your account must be fully verified before you can switch to Live Mode.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Submit your KYC documents">
    Complete all four sections in the Compliance tab: Business Information, Documents, Directors, and Shareholders/UBOs. See [Complete Verification](/get-started/complete-verification).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for approval">
    Fincra reviews your submission and notifies you by email when your account is approved. The Live Mode toggle in the dashboard becomes available once approved.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## 2. Set up production credentials

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate a production API key">
    Switch to **Live Mode** in the dashboard, then go to **Settings → Developer → API Keys** to generate your production API key. See [Manage API Keys](/developer-resources/manage-api-keys).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Note your production public key">
    Your `x-pub-key` is auto-generated and environment-specific. Copy the Live Mode version — you'll need it to initialize Checkout.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy your production webhook secret">
    Your webhook secret is also environment-specific. Copy the Live Mode version for validating incoming webhook signatures.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Never expose your `api-key` in client-side code, mobile apps, or public repositories. Rotate it immediately if you suspect it has been compromised.
</Warning>

## 3. Update your integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Replace your API key">
    Swap your sandbox API key for your production key across all server-side environments (staging, production). Double-check environment variables and CI/CD configs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update your base URL">
    Switch all API requests from the sandbox URL to the production URL:

    ```
    Sandbox:    https://sandboxapi.fincra.com
    Production: https://api.fincra.com
    ```

    Search your codebase for any remaining sandbox URLs before deploying.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update your public key and webhook secret">
    Replace your sandbox `x-pub-key` and webhook secret with the production versions in your frontend and webhook handler respectively.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## 4. Configure production webhooks

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add your production webhook endpoint">
    Go to **Settings → Webhooks** in Live Mode and add your production server URL. Use your real server — not localhost or a testing tool like Webhook.site.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm signature validation is working">
    Your webhook handler must validate the signature on every incoming event using your production webhook secret. See [Verify Webhooks](/webhooks/verify).
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## 5. Activate restricted products (if applicable)

Some products are not available by default and require activation by your Fincra account manager.

| Product | Available after KYC? | Requires activation? |
|---|---|---|
| Virtual Accounts (NGN) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Payment Links | ✅ | ❌ |
| Checkout | ✅ | ❌ |
| Payouts | ✅ | ❌ |
| Currency Conversion | ✅ | ❌ |
| Direct Charge API | ❌ | ✅ |
| Card Collections | ❌ | ✅ |
| Mobile Money Collections | ❌ | ✅ |
| Direct Debit | ❌ | ✅ |

<Info>
  Contact your Fincra account manager to request activation for products marked above. Activation involves a compliance review and is separate from your initial KYC.
</Info>

---

## 6. Run a live smoke test

<Steps>
  <Step title="Process a small real transaction">
    Run a low-value live transaction using your own payment details — a payment, payout, or conversion depending on what you've built. Confirm it completes successfully end-to-end.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm the webhook fires">
    Verify your production webhook endpoint receives the event, your handler processes it correctly, and your system returns a `200` response.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify reconciliation">
    Confirm the transaction appears correctly in your system records and matches what appears in the Fincra dashboard.
  </Step>
</Steps>
