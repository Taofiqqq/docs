## How it works

1. **Collect beneficiary details** — Gather the account number, bank code, and account type from your customer or payout recipient.
2. **Call the verification endpoint** — Send a `POST` request to `/core/accounts/resolve` with the beneficiary details.
3. **Check the response** — Fincra returns the account holder's name and verification status.
4. **Proceed or reject** — If the details match, proceed with the payout. If not, flag the transaction before sending funds to the wrong recipient.

## When to use this

- **Before creating a payout** — Verify the beneficiary's account details are valid before initiating a transfer.
- **During onboarding** — Validate account details when a customer or vendor adds their bank information.
- **Reconciliation** — Confirm account ownership when resolving payment disputes.
