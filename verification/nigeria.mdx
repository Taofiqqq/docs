Nigerian bank accounts are verified using the NUBAN (Nigeria Uniform Bank Account Number) system. You can resolve an account number against a bank code to retrieve the account holder's name.

| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|
| Account type | `bank_account` |
| Currency | `NGN` |
| Name matching | Yes — returns account holder's full name |

## Required fields

Send a `POST` request to `/core/accounts/resolve` with the following parameters:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `accountNumber` | string | The beneficiary's NUBAN account number |
| `bankCode` | string | The bank's unique code |
| `currency` | string | Must be `NGN` |
| `type` | string | Must be `bank_account` |

}
```

## Result handling

| Response | Action |
|---|---|
