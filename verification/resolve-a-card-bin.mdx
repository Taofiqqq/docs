---

A Bank Identification Number (BIN) is the first 6-8 digits of a card number. Use this endpoint to look up card metadata — including the card scheme, issuing country, card type, and issuing bank.

| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|
| Endpoint | `GET /checkout/resolve/bin/{bin}` |
| Method | GET |
| Authentication | API key |

## When to use this

- **Fraud screening** — Verify the card's issuing country matches the customer's location before processing a payment.
- **Routing** — Determine the card scheme (Visa, Mastercard, AfriGo, etc.) to route the transaction to the right processor.
- **UI enhancement** — Display the card brand and type to the customer during checkout.

## Request

Pass the BIN as a path parameter:

```
GET /checkout/resolve/bin/539941
```

| Parameter | Type | Location | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bin` | string | Path | The first 6-8 digits of the card number |
