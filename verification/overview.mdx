Fincra's verification endpoints let you validate account details, resolve customer identities, and look up card metadata — all before you process a transaction. Use them to reduce failed payouts, prevent fraud, and meet compliance requirements.

## Use cases

- **Pre-payout validation** — Verify a beneficiary's bank account or mobile money wallet before initiating a payout to avoid failed transfers and misdirected funds.
- **Customer onboarding** — Resolve a customer's BVN when they request a permanent virtual account to confirm their identity and meet compliance requirements.
- **Card payment screening** — Look up a card's BIN during checkout to detect the card scheme, issuing country, and card type for fraud prevention and routing decisions.
